the Gospel of Beauty</big></p>


<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br />

<small><i>I Start on My Walk</i></small></h2>


<p>As some of the readers of this account are
aware, I took a walk last summer from
my home town, Springfield, Illinois, across
Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, up and down
Colorado and into New Mexico. One of the
most vivid little episodes of the trip, that
came after two months of walking, I would
like to tell at this point. It was in southern
Colorado. It was early morning. Around
the cliff, with a boom, a rattle and a bang,
appeared a gypsy wagon. On the front seat
was a Romany, himself dressed inconspicuously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
but with his woman more bedecked
than Carmen. She wore the bangles and
spangles of her Hindu progenitors. The
woman began to shout at me, I could not
distinguish just what. The two seemed to
think this was the gayest morning the sun
ever shone upon. They came faster and
faster, then, suddenly, at the woman's suggestion,
pulled up short. And she asked me
with a fraternal, confidential air, "What you
sellin', what you sellin', boy?"</p>

<p>If we had met on the first of June, when
I had just started, she would have pretended
to know all about me, she would have asked
to tell my fortune. On the first of June I
wore about the same costume I wear on the
streets of Springfield. I was white as paper
from two years of writing poetry indoors.
Now, on the first of August I was sunburned
a quarter of an inch deep. My costume,
once so respectable, I had gradually
transformed till it looked like that of a show-man.
I wore very yellow corduroys, a fancy
sombrero and an oriflamme tie. So Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Gypsy hailed me as a brother. She eyed
my little worn-out oil-cloth pack. It was a
delightful professional mystery to her.</p>

<p>I handed up a sample of what it contained&mdash;my
<i>Gospel of Beauty</i> (a little one-page
formula for making America lovelier), and
my little booklet, <i>Rhymes to Be Traded for
Bread</i>.</p>

<p>The impatient horses went charging on.
In an instant came more noises. Four more
happy gypsy wagons passed. Each time
the interview was repeated in identical language,
and with the same stage business.
The men were so silent and masterful-looking,
the girls such brilliant, inquisitive cats!
I never before saw anything so like high-class
comic opera off the stage, and in fancy
I still see it all:&mdash;those brown, braceleted
arms still waving, and those provocative
siren cries:&mdash;"What you sellin', boy? What
you sellin'?"</p>

<p>I hope my Gospel did them good. Its
essential principle is that one should not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a gypsy forever. He should return home.
Having returned, he should plant the seeds
of Art and of Beauty. He should tend them
till they grow. There is something essentially
humorous about a man walking rapidly
away from his home town to tell all men
they should go back to their birthplaces. It
is still more humorous that, when I finally
did return home, it was sooner than I intended,
all through a temporary loss of
nerve. But once home I have taken my own
advice to heart. I have addressed four
mothers' clubs, one literary club, two missionary
societies and one High School Debating
Society upon the Gospel of Beauty.
And the end is not yet. No, not by any
means. As John Paul Jones once said, "I
have not yet begun to fight."</p>

<p>I had set certain rules of travel, evolved
and proved practicable in previous expeditions
in the East and South. These rules
had been published in various periodicals before
my start. The home town newspapers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
my puzzled but faithful friends in good
times and in bad, went the magazines one
better and added a rule or so. To promote
the gala character of the occasion, a certain
paper announced that I was to walk in a
Roman toga with bare feet encased in sandals.
Another added that I had travelled
through most of the countries of Europe in
this manner. It made delightful reading.
Scores of mere acquaintances crossed the
street to shake hands with me on the strength
of it.</p>

<p>The actual rules were to have nothing to
do with cities, railroads, money, baggage or
fellow tramps. I was to begin to ask for
dinner about a quarter of eleven and for
supper, lodging and breakfast about a quarter
of five. I was to be neat, truthful, civil
and on the square. I was to preach the Gospel
of Beauty. How did these rules work
out?</p>

<p>The cities were easy to let alone. I
passed quickly through Hannibal and Jefferson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
City. Then, straight West, it was
nothing but villages and farms till the three
main cities of Colorado. Then nothing but
desert to central New Mexico. I did not
take the train till I reached central New
Mexico, nor did I write to Springfield for
money till I quit the whole game at that
point.</p>

<p>Such wages as I made I sent home, starting
out broke again, first spending just
enough for one day's recuperation out of
each pile, and, in the first case, rehabilitating
my costume considerably. I always walked
penniless. My baggage was practically nil.
It was mainly printed matter, renewed by
mail. Sometimes I carried reproductions of
drawings of mine, <i>The Village Improvement
Parade</i>, a series of picture-cartoons
with many morals.</p>

<p>I pinned this on the farmers' walls, explaining
the mottoes on the banners, and exhorting
them to study it at their leisure. My
little pack had a supply of the aforesaid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<i>Rhymes to Be Traded for Bread</i>. And it
contained the following Gospel of Beauty:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>THE GOSPEL OF BEAUTY</i></p>

<p><i>Being the new "creed of a beggar" by
that vain and foolish mendicant Nicholas
Vachel Lindsay, printed for his personal
friends in his home village&mdash;Springfield,
Illinois. It is his intention to carry this gospel
across the country beginning June, 1912,
returning in due time.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>I</i></p>

<p><i>I come to you penniless and afoot, to bring
a message. I am starting a new religious
idea. The idea does not say "no" to any
creed that you have heard.... After
this, let the denomination to which you now
belong be called in your heart "the church
of beauty" or "the church of the open sky."
... The church of beauty has two sides:
the love of beauty and the love of God.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>II</i><br />

<i>THE NEW LOCALISM</i></p>

<p><i>The things most worth while are one's
own hearth and neighborhood. We should
make our own home and neighborhood the
most democratic, the most beautiful and the
holiest in the world. The children now
growing up should become devout gardeners
or architects or park architects or teachers
of dancing in the Greek spirit or musicians
or novelists or poets or story-writers or
craftsmen or wood-carvers or dramatists or
actors or singers. They should find their
talent and nurse it industriously. They
should believe in every possible application
to art-theory of the thoughts of the Declaration
of Independence and Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address. They should, if led by the
spirit, wander over the whole nation in
search of the secret of democratic beauty
with their hearts at the same time filled to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<i>overflowing with the righteousness of God.
Then they should come back to their own
hearth and neighborhood and gather a little
circle of their own sort of workers about
them and strive to make the neighborhood
and home more beautiful and democratic
and holy with their special art....
They should labor in their little circle expecting
neither reward nor honors.... In
their darkest hours they should be made
strong by the vision of a completely beautiful
neighborhood and the passion for a
completely democratic art. Their reason
for living should be that joy in beauty
which no wounds can take away, and that
joy in the love of God which no crucifixion
can end.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The kindly reader at this point clutches
his brow and asks, "But why carry this paper
around? Why, in Heaven's name, do it as
a beggar? Why do it at all?"</p>

<p>Let me make haste to say that there has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
been as yet no accredited, accepted way for
establishing Beauty in the heart of the average
American. <i>Until such a way has been
determined upon by a competent committee</i>,
I must be pardoned for taking my own
course and trying any experiment I please.</p>

<p>But I hope to justify the space occupied
by this narrative, not by the essential seriousness
of my intentions, nor the essential
solemnity of my motley cloak, nor by the
final failure or success of the trip, but by
the things I unexpectedly ran into, as curious
to me as to the gentle and sheltered
reader. Of all that I saw the State of Kansas
impressed me most, and the letters home
I have chosen cover, for the most part, adventures
there.</p>

<p>Kansas, the Ideal American Community!
Kansas, nearer than any other to the kind
of a land our fathers took for granted!
Kansas, practically free from cities and industrialism,
the real last refuge of the constitution,
since it maintains the type of agricultural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
civilization the constitution had in
mind! Kansas, State of tremendous crops
and hardy, devout, natural men! Kansas
of the historic Santa Fé Trail and the classic
village of Emporia and the immortal editor
of Emporia! Kansas, laid out in roads a
mile apart, criss-crossing to make a great
checker-board, roads that go on and on past
endless rich farms and big farm-houses,
though there is not a village or railroad for
miles! Kansas, the land of the real country
gentlemen, Americans who work the soil and
own the soil they work; State where the
shabby tenant-dwelling scarce appears as
yet! Kansas of the Chautauqua and the college
student and the devout school-teacher!
The dry State, the automobile State, the insurgent
State! Kansas, that is ruled by the
cross-roads church, and the church type of
civilization! The Newest New England!
State of more promise of permanent spiritual
glory than Massachusetts in her brilliant
youth!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Travellers who go through in cars with
roofs know little of this State. Kansas is
not Kansas till we march day after day,
away from the sunrise, under the blistering
noon sky, on, on over a straight west-going
road toward the sunset. Then we begin to
have our spirits stirred by the sight of the
tremendous clouds looming over the most interminable
plain that ever expanded and
made glorious the heart of Man.</p>

<p>I have walked in eastern Kansas where
the hedged fields and the orchards and gardens
reminded one of the picturesque sections
of Indiana, of antique and settled
Ohio. Later I have mounted a little hill on
what was otherwise a level and seemingly uninhabited
universe, and traced, away to the
left, the creeping Arkansas, its course
marked by the cottonwoods, that became
like tufts of grass on its far borders. All
the rest of the world was treeless and riverless,
yet green from the rain of yesterday,
and patterned like a carpet with the shadows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the clouds. I have walked on and on
across this unbroken prairie-sod where half-wild
cattle grazed. Later I have marched
between alfalfa fields where hovered the lavender
haze of the fragrant blossom, and have
heard the busy music of the gorging bumblebees.
Later I have marched for days and
days with wheat waving round me, yellow
as the sun. Many's the night I have slept in
the barn-lofts of Kansas with the wide loft-door
rolled open and the inconsequential
golden moon for my friend.</p>

<p>These selections from letters home tell
how I came into Kansas and how I adventured
there. The letters were written avowedly
as a sort of diary of the trip, but their
contents turned out to be something less than
that, something more than that, and something
rather different.</p>



<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Thursday, May 30, 1912.</span> In the blue
grass by the side of the road. Somewhere
west of Jacksonville, Illinois. Hot sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Cool wind. Rabbits in the distance. Bumblebees
near.</p>

<p>At five last evening I sighted my lodging
for the night. It was the other side of a
high worm fence. It was down in the hollow
of a grove. It was the box of an old
box-car, brought there somehow, without its
wheels. It was far from a railroad. I said
in my heart "Here is the appointed shelter."
I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>As was subsequently revealed, it belonged
to the old gentleman I spied through the
window stemming gooseberries and singing:
"John Brown's body." He puts the car top
on wagon wheels and hauls it from grove to
grove between Jacksonville and the east
bank of the Mississippi. He carries a saw
mill equipment along. He is clearing this
wood for the owner, of all but its walnut
trees. He lives in the box with his son and
two assistants. He is cook, washerwoman
and saw-mill boss. His wife died many
years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman let me in with alacrity.
He allowed me to stem gooseberries
while he made a great supper for the boys.
They soon came in. I was meanwhile assured
that my name was going into the pot.
My host looked like his old general, McClellan.
He was eloquent on the sins of
preachers, dry voters and pension reformers.
He was full of reminiscences of the string
band at Sherman's headquarters, in which
he learned to perfect himself on his wonderful
fiddle. He said, "I can't play slow music.
I've got to play dance tunes or die."
He did not die. His son took a banjo from
an old trunk and the two of them gave us
every worth while tune on earth: <i>Money
Musk</i>, <i>Hell's Broke Loose in Georgia</i>, <i>The
Year of Jubilee</i>, <i>Sailor's Hornpipe</i>, <i>Baby
on the Block</i>, <i>Lady on the Lake</i>, and <i>The
Irish Washerwoman</i>, while I stemmed gooseberries,
which they protested I did not need
to do. Then I read my own unworthy
verses to the romantic and violin-stirred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
company. And there was room for all of
us to sleep in that one repentant and converted
box-car.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Friday, May 31, 1912.</span> Half an hour
after a dinner of crackers, cheese and raisins,
provided at my solicitation by the grocer in
the general store and post-office, Valley
City, Illinois.</p>

<p>I have thought of a new way of stating
my economic position. I belong to one of
the leisure classes, that of the rhymers. In
order to belong to any leisure class, one must
be a thief or a beggar. On the whole I prefer
to be a beggar, and, before each meal,
receive from toiling man new permission to
extend my holiday. The great business of
that world that looms above the workshop
and the furrow is to take things from people
by some sort of taxation or tariff or special
privilege. But I want to exercise my covetousness
only in a retail way, open and above
board, and when I take bread from a man's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
table I want to ask him for that particular
piece of bread, as politely as I can.</p>

<p>But this does not absolutely fit my life.
For yesterday I ate several things without
permission, for instance, in mid-morning I
devoured all the cherries a man can hold.
They were hanging from heavy, breaking
branches that came way over the stone wall
into the road.</p>

<p>Another adventure. Early in the afternoon
I found a brick farm-house. It had a
noble porch. There were marks of old-fashioned
distinction in the trimmed hedges
and flower-beds, and in the summer-houses.
The side-yard and barn-lot were the cluckingest,
buzzingest kind of places. There was
not a human being in sight. I knocked and
knocked on the doors. I wandered through
all the sheds. I could look in through the
unlocked screens and see every sign of present
occupation. If I had chosen to enter I
could have stolen the wash bowl or the baby-buggy
or the baby's doll. The creamery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was more tempting, with milk and butter
and eggs, and freshly pulled taffy cut in
squares. I took a little taffy. That is all
I took, though the chickens were very social
and I could have eloped with several of
them. The roses and peonies and geraniums
were entrancing, and there was not a watch
dog anywhere. Everything seemed to say
"<i>Enter in and possess</i>!"</p>

<p>I saw inside the last door where I knocked
a crisp, sweet, simple dress on a chair. Ah,
a sleeping beauty somewhere about!</p>

<p>I went away from that place.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Sunday, June 1, 1912.</span> By the side of
the road, somewhere in Illinois.</p>

<p>Last night I was dead tired. I hailed a
man by the shed of a stationary engine. I
asked him if I could sleep in the engine-shed
all night, beginning right now. He
said "Yes." But from five to six, he put me
out of doors, on a pile of gunny sacks on
the grass. There I slept while the ducks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
quacked in my ears, and the autos whizzed
over the bridge three feet away. My host
was a one-legged man. In about an hour
he came poking me with that crutch and that
peg of his. He said "Come, and let me tell
your fortune! I have been studying your
physiognifry while you were asleep!" So
we sat on a log by the edge of the pond.
He said: "I am the Seventh Son of a Seventh
Son. They call me the duck-pond diviner.
I forecast the weather for these
parts. Every Sunday I have my corner for
the week's weather in the paper here." Then
he indulged in a good deal of the kind of
talk one finds in the front of the almanac.</p>

<p>He was a little round man with a pair of
round, dull eyes, and a dull, round face,
with a two weeks' beard upon it. He
squinted up his eyes now. He was deliberate.
Switch engines were going by. He
paused to hail the engineers. Here is a part
of what he finally said: "You are a Child
of Destiny." He hesitated, for he wanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to be sure of the next point. "You were
born in the month of S-e-p-t-e-m-b-e-r.
Your preference is for a business like clerking
in a store. You are of a slow, <i>pigmatic</i>
temperament, but I can see you are fastidious
about your eating. You do not use tobacco.
You are fond of sweets. You have
been married twice. Your first wife died,
and your second was divorced. You look
like you would make a good spiritualist medium.
If you don't let any black cats cross
your track you will have good luck for the
next three years."</p>

<p>He hit it right twice. I <i>am</i> a Child of
Destiny and I <i>am</i> fond of sweets. When a
prophet hits it right on essentials like that,
who would be critical?</p>

<p>An old woman with a pipe in her mouth
came down the railroad embankment looking
for greens. He bawled at her "Git out
of that." But on she came. When she was
closer he said: "Them weeds is full of
poison oak." She grunted, and kept working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
her way toward us, and with a belligerent
swagger marched past us on into the
engine-room, carrying a great mess of
greens in her muddy hands.</p>

<p>There was scarcely space in that little shed
for the engine, and it was sticking out in
several places. Yet it dawned on me that
this was the wife of my host, that they kept
house with that engine for the principal article
of furniture. Without a word of introduction
or explanation she stood behind
me and mumbled, "You need your supper,
son. Come in."</p>

<p>There was actually a side-room in that
little box, a side room with a cot and a cupboard
as well. On the floor was what was
once a rug. But it had had a long kitchen
history. She dipped a little unwashed bowl
into a larger unwashed bowl, with an unwashed
thumb doing its whole duty. She
handed me a fuzzy, unwashed spoon and
said with a note of real kindness, "Eat your
supper, young man." She patted me on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
shoulder with a sticky hand. Then she stood,
looking at me fixedly. The woman had only
half her wits.</p>

<p>I suppose they kept that stew till it was
used up, and then made another. I was a
Child of Destiny, all right, and Destiny decreed
I should eat. I sat there trying to
think of things to say to make agreeable conversation,
and postpone the inevitable.
Finally I told her I wanted to be a little boy
once more, and take my bowl and eat on the
log by the pond in the presence of Nature.</p>

<p>She maintained that genial silence which
indicates a motherly sympathy. I left her
smoking and smiling there. And like a little
child that knows not the folly of waste, I
slyly fed my supper to the ducks.</p>

<p>At bedtime the old gentleman slept in his
clothes on the cot in the kitchenette. He
had the dog for a foot-warmer. There was
a jar of yeast under the table. Every so
often the old gentleman would call for the
old lady to come and drive the ducks out, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
they would get the board off the jar. Ever
and anon the ducks had a taste before the
avenger arrived.</p>

<p>On one side of the engine the old lady had
piled gunny-sacks for my bed. That softened
the cement-floor foundation. Then she
insisted on adding that elegant rug from
the kitchen, to protect me from the fuzz on
the sacks. She herself slept on a pile of excelsior
with a bit of canvas atop. She kept
a cat just by her cheek to keep her warm,
and I have no doubt the pretty brute whispered
things in her ear. Tabby was the one
aristocratic, magical touch:&mdash;one of these
golden coon-cats.</p>

<p>The old lady's bed was on the floor, just
around the corner from me, on the other side
of the engine. That engine stretched its
vast bulk between us. It was as the sword
between the duke and the queen in the fairy
story. But every so often, in response to
the old gentleman's alarm, the queen would
come climbing over my feet in order to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to the kitchen and drive out the ducks.
From where I lay I could see through two
doors to the night outside. I could watch
the stealthy approach of the white and
waddling marauders. Do not tell me a duck
has no sense of humor. It was a great game
of tag to them. It occurred as regularly as
the half hours were reached. I could time
the whole process by the ticking in my soul,
while presumably asleep. And while waiting
for them to come up I could see the pond
and a star reflected in the pond, the star of
my Destiny, no doubt. At last it began to
rain. Despite considerations of fresh air,
the door was shut, and soon everybody was
asleep.</p>

<p>The bed was not verminiferous. I dislike
all jokes on such a theme, but in this case
the issue must be met. It is the one thing
the tramp wants to know about his bunk.
That peril avoided, there is nothing to quarrel
about. Despite all the grotesquerie of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that night, I am grateful for a roof, and
two gentle friends.</p>

<p>Poor things! Just like all the citizens of
the twentieth century, petting and grooming
machinery three times as smart as they are
themselves. Such people should have engines
to take care of them, instead of taking
care of engines. There stood the sleek brute
in its stall, absorbing all, giving nothing,
pumping supplies only for its own caste;&mdash;water
to be fed to other engines.</p>

<p>But seldom are keepers of engine-stables
as unfortunate as these. The best they can
get from the world is cruel laughter. Yet
this woman, crippled in brain, her soul only
half alive, this dull man, crippled in body,
had God's gift of the liberal heart. If they
are supremely absurd, so are all of us. We
must include ourselves in the farce. These
two, tottering through the dimness and vexation
of our queer world, were willing the
stranger should lean upon them. I say they
had the good gift of the liberal heart. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
thing was theirs to divide. That was a roof.
They gave me my third and they helped me
to hide from the rain. In the name of St.
Francis I laid me down. May that saint of
all saints be with them, and with all the
gentle and innocent and weary and broken!</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br />

<small><i>Walking Through Missouri</i></small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday Morning, June 4, 1912.</span> In a
hotel bedroom in Laddonia, Missouri. I occupy
this room without charge.</p>

<p>Through the mercy of the gateman I
crossed the Hannibal toll-bridge without
paying fare, and the more enjoyed the
pearly Mississippi in the evening twilight.
Walking south of Hannibal next morning,
Sunday, I was irresistibly reminded of Kentucky.
It was the first real "pike" of my
journey,&mdash;solid gravel, and everyone was
exercising his racing pony in his racing cart,
and giving me a ride down lovely avenues
of trees. Here, as in dozens of other interesting
"lifts" in Illinois, I had the driver's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
complete attention, recited <i>The Gospel of
Beauty</i> through a series of my more didactic
rhymes till I was tired, and presented the
<i>Village Improvement Parade</i> and the
<i>Rhymes to Be Traded for Bread</i> and exhorted
the comradely driver to forget me
never. One colored horseman hitched forward
on the plank of his breaking-cart and
gave me his seat. Then came quite a ride
into New London. He asked, "So you goin'
to walk west to the mountains and all
around?" "Yes, if this colt don't break my
neck, or I don't lose my nerve or get bitten
by a dog or anything." "Will you walk
back?" "Maybe so, maybe not." He pondered
a while, then said, with the Bert Williams
manner, "<i>You'll ride back. Mark my
words, you'll ride back!</i>"</p>

<p>He asked a little later, "Goin' to harves'
in Kansas?" I assured him I was not going
to harvest in Kansas. He rolled his big white
eyes at me: "What in the name of Uncle
Hillbilly <i>air</i> you up to then?"</p>

<p>In this case I could not present my tracts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for I was holding on to him for dear life.
Just then he turned off my road. Getting
out of the cart I nearly hung myself; and
the colt was away again before I could say
"Thank you."</p>

<p>Yesterday I passed through what was
mostly a flat prairie country, abounding in
the Missouri mule. I met one man on horseback
driving before him an enormous specimen
tied head to head with a draught-horse.
The mule was continually dragging his good-natured
comrade into the ditch and being
jerked out again. The mule is a perpetual
inquisitor and experimenter. He followed
me along the fence with the alertest curiosity,
when he was inside the field, yet meeting
me in the road, he often showed deadly terror.
If he was a mule colt, following his
mare mamma along the pike, I had to stand
in the side lane or hide behind a tree till he
went by, or else he would turn and run as
if the very devil were after him. Then the
farmer on the mare would have to pursue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
him a considerable distance, and drive him
back with cuss words. 'Tis sweet to stir up
so much emotion, even in the breast of an
animal.</p>

<p>What do you suppose happened in New
London? I approached what I thought a
tiny Baptist chapel of whitewashed stone.
Noting it was about sermon-time, and feeling
like repenting, I walked in. Behold, the
most harmoniously-colored Catholic shrine
in the world! The sermon was being
preached by the most gorgeously robed
priest one could well conceive. The father
went on to show how a vision of the Christ-child
had appeared on the altar of a lax
congregation in Spain. From that time
those people, stricken with reverence and
godly fear, put that church into repair, and
the community became a true servant of the
Lord. Infidels were converted, heretics
were confounded.</p>

<p>After the sermon came the climax of the
mass, and from the choir loft above my head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
came the most passionate religious singing
I ever heard in my life. The excellence of
the whole worship, even to the preaching of
visions, was a beautiful surprise.</p>

<p>People do not open their eyes enough,
neither their spiritual nor their physical eyes.
They are not sensitive enough to loveliness
either visible or by the pathway of visions.
I wish every church in the world could see
the Christ-child on the altar, every Methodist
and Baptist as well as every Catholic
congregation.</p>

<p>With these thoughts I sat and listened
while that woman soloist sang not only
through the Mass, but the Benediction of
the Blessed Sacrament as well. The whole
surprise stands out like a blazing star in my
memory.</p>

<p>I say we do not see enough visions. I
wish that, going out of the church door at
noon, every worshipper in America could
spiritually discern the Good St. Francis
come down to our earth and singing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Sun. I wish that saint would return. I
wish he would preach voluntary poverty to
all the middle-class and wealthy folk of this
land, with the power that once shook Europe.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Friday, June 7, 1912.</span> In the mid-afternoon
in the woods, many miles west of Jefferson
City. I am sitting by a wild rose
bush. I am looking down a long sunlit vista
of trees.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening, three miles from
Fulton, Missouri, I encountered a terrific
storm. I tried one farm-house just before
the rain came down, but they would not let
me in, not even into the barn. They said it
was "not convenient." They said there was
another place a little piece ahead, anyway.
Pretty soon I was considerably rained upon.
But the "other place" did not appear. Later
the thunder and lightning were frightful.
It seemed to me everything was being struck
all around me: because of the sheer downpour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
it became pitch dark. It seemed as
though the very weight of the rain would
beat me into the ground. Yet I felt that I
needed the washing. The night before I
enjoyed the kind of hospitality that makes
one yearn for a bath.</p>

<p>At last I saw a light ahead. I walked
through more cataracts and reached it.
Then I knocked at the door. I entered what
revealed itself to be a negro cabin. Mine
host was Uncle Remus himself, only a person
of more delicacy and dignity. He appeared
to be well preserved, though he was
eighteen years old when the war broke out.
He owns forty acres and more than one
mule. His house was sweet and clean, all
metal surfaces polished, all wood-work
scrubbed white, all linen fresh laundered.
He urged me to dry at his oven. It was a
long process, taking much fuel. He allowed
me to eat supper and breakfast with
him and his family, which honor I scarcely
deserved. The old man said grace standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
up. Then we sat down and he said another.
The first was just family prayers. The second
was thanksgiving for the meal. The
table was so richly and delicately provided
that within my heart I paraphrased the
twenty-third Psalm, though I did not quote
it out aloud: "Thou preparest a table before
me in the presence of mine enemies"&mdash;(namely,
the thunder and lightning, and the
inhospitable white man!).</p>

<p>I hope to be rained on again if it brings
me communion bread like that I ate with
my black host. The conversation was about
many things, but began religiously; how
"<i>Ol' Master in the sky gave us everything
here to take keer of, and said we mussent
waste any of it</i>." The wife was a mixture of
charming diffidence and eagerness in offering
her opinion on these points of political
economy and theology.</p>

<p>After supper the old gentleman told me
a sweet-singing field-bird I described was
called the "Rachel-Jane." He had five children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
grown and away from home and one
sleek first voter still under his roof. The
old gentleman asked the inevitable question:
"Goin' west harvestin'?"</p>

<p>I said "No" again. Then I spread out
and explained <i>The Village Improvement
Parade</i>. This did not interest the family
much, but they would never have done with
asking me questions about Lincoln. And
the fact that I came from Lincoln's home
town was plainly my chief distinction in their
eyes. The best bed was provided for me,
and warm water in which to bathe, and I
slept the sleep of the clean and regenerated
in snowy linen. Next morning the sun
shone, and I walked the muddy roads as
cheerfully as though they were the paths of
Heaven.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Sunday Morning, June 9, 1912.</span> I am
writing in the railroad station at Tipton,
Missouri.</p>

<p>A little while back a few people began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to ask me to work for my meals. I believe
this is because the "genteel" appearance
with which I started has become something
else. My derby hat has been used for so
many things,&mdash;to keep off a Noah's flood of
rain, to catch cherries in, to fight bumblebees,
to cover my face while asleep, and keep
away the vague terrors of the night,&mdash;that
it is still a hat, but not quite in the mode.
My face is baked by the sun and my hands
are fried and stewed. My trousers are
creased not in one place, but all over. These
things made me look more like a person who,
in the words of the conventional world,
"<i>ought to work</i>."</p>

<p>Having been requested to work once or
twice, I immediately made it my custom to
offer labor-power as a preliminary to the
meal. I generally ask about five people before
I find the one who happens to be in a
meal-giving mood. This kindly person,
about two-thirds of the time, refuses to let
me work. I insist and insist, but he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"Aw, come in and eat anyway." The man
who accepts my offer of work may let me
cut weeds, or hoe corn or potatoes, but he
generally shows me the woodpile and the
axe. Even then every thud of that inevitably
dull instrument seems to go through
him. After five minutes he thinks I have
worked an hour, and he comes to the porch
and shouts: "Come in and get your dinner."</p>

<p>Assuming a meal is worth thirty-five
cents, I have never yet worked out the worth
of one, at day-laborer's wages. Very often
I am called into the house three times before
I come. Whether I work or not, the meals
are big and good. Perhaps there is a little
closer attention to <i>The Gospel of Beauty</i>,
after three unheeded calls to dinner.</p>

<p>After the kindling is split and the meal
eaten and they lean back in their chairs,
a-weary of their mirth, by one means or another
I show them how I am knocking at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the door of the world with a dream in my
hand.</p>

<p>Because of the multitudes of tramps pouring
west on the freight trains,&mdash;tramps I
never see because I let freight cars alone,&mdash;night
accommodations are not so easy to get
as they were in my other walks in Pennsylvania
and Georgia. I have not yet been
forced to sleep under the stars, but each
evening has been a scramble. There must
be some better solution to this problem of a
sleeping-place.</p>

<p>The country hotel, if there is one around,
is sometimes willing to take in the man who
flatly says he is broke. For instance, the
inn-keeper's wife at Clarksburg was tenderly
pitiful, yea, she was kind to me after
the fashion of the holiest of the angels.
There was a protracted meeting going on
in the town. That was, perhaps, the reason
for her exalted heart. But, whatever the
reason, in this one case I was welcomed with
such kindness and awe that I dared not lift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
up my haughty head or distribute my poems,
or give tongue to my views, or let her suspect
for a moment I was a special <span class="smcap">idea</span> on
legs. It was much lovelier to have her think
I was utterly forlorn.</p>

<p>This morning when I said good-bye I
fumbled my hat, mumbled my words and
shuffled my feet, and may the Good St.
Francis reward her.</p>

<p>When I asked the way to Tipton the
farmer wanted me to walk the railroad.
People cannot see "why the Sam Hill" anyone
wants to walk the highway when the
rails make a bee-line for the destination.
This fellow was so anxious for the preservation
of my feet he insisted it looked like
rain. I finally agreed that, for the sake of
avoiding a wetting, I had best hurry to Tipton
by the ties. The six miles of railroad
between Clarksburg and Tipton should be
visited by every botanist in the United
States. Skip the rest of this letter unless
you are interested in a catalogue of flowers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>First comes the reed with the deep blue
blossoms at the top that has bloomed by my
path all the way from Springfield, Illinois.
Then come enormous wild roses, showing
every hue that friend of man ever displayed.
Behold an army of white poppies join our
march, then healthy legions of waving mustard.
Our next recruits are tiny golden-hearted
ragged kinsmen of the sunflower.
No comrades depart from this triumphal
march to Tipton. Once having joined us,
they continue in our company. The mass
of color grows deeper and more subtle each
moment. Behold, regiments of pale lavender
larkspur. 'Tis an excellent garden, the
finer that it needs no tending. Though the
rain has failed to come, I begin to be glad I
am hobbling along over the vexatious ties.
I forget my resolve to run for President.</p>

<p>Once I determined to be a candidate. I
knew I would get the tramp-vote and the
actor-vote. My platform was to be that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
railroad ties should be just close enough for
men to walk on them in natural steps, neither
mincing the stride nor widely stretching the
legs.</p>

<p>Not yet have we reached Tipton. Behold
a white flower, worthy of a better name, that
the farmers call "sheep's tea." Behold
purple larkspur joining the lavender larkspur.
Behold that disreputable camp-follower
the button-weed, wearing its shabby
finery. Now a red delicate grass joins in,
and a big purple and pink sort of an aster.
Behold a pink and white sheep's tea. And
look, there is a dwarf morning glory, the
sweetest in the world. Here is a group of
black-eyed Susans, marching like suffragettes
to get the vote at Tipton. Here is a
war-dance of Indian Paint. And here are
bluebells.</p>

<p>"Goin' west harvestin'?"</p>

<p>"I have harvested already, ten thousand
flowers an hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">June 10, 1912.</span> 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Three miles west
of Sedalia, Missouri. In the woods. Near
the automobile road to Kansas City.</p>

<p>Now that I have passed Sedalia I am
pretty well on toward the Kansas line.
Only three more days' journey, and then I
shall be in Kansas, State of Romance, State
of Expectation. Goodness knows Missouri
has plenty of incident, plenty of merit. But
it is a cross between Illinois and northern
Kentucky, and to beg here is like begging
in my own back-yard.</p>

<p>But the heart of Kansas is the heart of
the West.... Inclosed find a feather
from the wing of a young chicken-hawk.
He happened across the road day before
yesterday. The farmer stopped the team
and killed him with his pitchfork. That
farmer seemed to think he had done the Lord
a service in ridding the world of a parasite.
Yet I had a certain fellow-feeling for the
hawk, as I have for anybody who likes
chicken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>This walk is full of suggestions for
poems. Sometimes, in a confidential moment,
I tell my hosts I am going to write a
chronicle of the whole trip in verse. But I
cannot write it now. The traveller at my
stage is in a kind of farm-hand condition of
mind and blood. He feels himself so much
a part of the soil and the sun and the
ploughed acres, he eats so hard and sleeps
so hard, he has little more patience in trying
to write than the husbandman himself.</p>

<p>If that poem is ever written I shall say,&mdash;to
my fellow-citizens of Springfield, for instance:&mdash;"I
have gone as your delegate to
greet the fields, to claim them for you
against a better day. I lay hold on these
furrows on behalf of all those cooped up in
cities."</p>

<p>I feel that in a certain mystical sense I
have made myself part of the hundreds and
hundreds of farms that lie between me and
machine-made America. I have scarcely
seen anything but crops since I left home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The whole human race is grubbing in the
soil, and the soil is responding with tremendous
vigor. By walking I get as tired as
any and imagine I work too. Sometimes
the glory goes. Then I feel my own idleness
above all other facts on earth. I want
to get to work immediately. But I suppose
I am a minstrel or nothing. (There goes a
squirrel through the treetops.)</p>

<p>Every time I say "No" to the question
"Goin' west harvestin'?" I am a little less
brisk about reciting that triad of poems that
I find is the best brief exposition of my
gospel: (1) <i>The Proud Farmer</i>, (2) <i>The
Illinois Village</i> and (3) <i>The Building of
Springfield</i>.</p>

<p>If I do harvest it is likely to be just as it
was at the Springfield water-works a year
ago, when I broke my back in a week trying
to wheel bricks.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">June 12, 1912.</span> On the banks of a stream
west of the town of Warrensburg, Missouri.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the problem of a night's lodging
has been solved. I seem to have found a
substitute for the spare bedrooms and white
sheets of Georgia and Pennsylvania. It appears
that no livery stable will refuse a man
a place to sleep. What happened at Otterville
and Warrensburg I can make happen
from here on, or so I am assured by a farm-hand.
He told me that every tiniest village
from here to western Kansas has at least
two livery stables and there a man may sleep
for the asking. He should try to get permission
to mount to the hay-mow, for, unless
the cot in the office is a mere stretch of
canvas, it is likely to be (excuse me) verminiferous.
The stable man asks if the mendicant
has matches or tobacco. If he has
he must give them up. Also he is told not
to poke his head far out of the loft window,
for, if the insurance man caught him, it
would be all up with the insurance. These
preliminaries quickly settled, the transient
requests a buggy-robe to sleep in, lest he be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
overwhelmed with the loan of a horse-blanket.
The objection to a horse-blanket
is that it is a horse-blanket.</p>

<p>And so, if I am to believe my friend with
the red neck, my good times at Warrensburg
and Otterville are likely to continue.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, sleeping in a hayloft
is Romance itself. The alfalfa is soft
and fragrant and clean, the wind blows
through the big loft door, the stars shine
through the cottonwoods. If I wake in the
night I hear the stable-boys bringing in the
teams of men who have driven a long way
and back again to get something;&mdash;to get
drunk, or steal the kisses of somebody's wife
or put over a political deal or get a chance
to preach a sermon;&mdash;and I get scraps of
detail from the stable-boys after the main
actors of the drama have gone. It sounds
as though all the remarks were being made
in the loft instead of on the ground floor.
The horses stamp and stamp and the grinding
sound of their teeth is so close to me I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
cannot believe at first that the mangers and
feed-boxes are way down below.</p>

<p>It is morning before I know it and the
gorged birds are singing "shivaree, shivaree,
Rachel Jane, Rachel Jane" in the mulberry
trees, just outside the loft window.
After a short walk I negotiate for breakfast,
then walk on through Paradise and at
the proper time negotiate for dinner, walk
on through Paradise again and at six negotiate
for the paradisical haymow, without
looking for supper, and again more sleepy
than hungry. The difference between this
system and the old one is that about half
past four I used to begin to worry about
supper and night accommodations, and generally
worried till seven. Now life is one
long sweet stroll, and I watch the sunset
from my bed in the alfalfa with the delights
of the whole day renewed in my heart.</p>

<p>Passing through the village of Sedalia I
inquired the way out of town to the main
road west. My informant was a man named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
McSweeny, drunk enough to be awfully
friendly. He asked all sorts of questions.
He induced me to step two blocks out of
my main course down a side-street to his
"Restaurant." He said he was not going to
let me leave town without a square meal. It
was a strange eating-place, full of ditch-diggers,
teamsters, red-necked politicians
and slender intellectual politicians. In the
background was a scattering of the furtive
daughters of pleasure, some white, some
black. The whole institution was but an
annex to the bar-room in front. Mr. McSweeny
looked over my book while I ate.
After the meal he gathered a group of the
politicians and commanded me to recite. I
gave them my rhyme in memory of Altgeld
and my rhyme in denunciation of Lorimer,
and my rhyme denouncing all who coöperated
in the white slave trade, including sellers
of drink. Mr. McSweeny said I was the
goods, and offered to pass the hat, but I
would not permit. A handsome black jezebel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sat as near us as she dared and listened
quite seriously. I am sure she would have
put something in that hat if it had gone
round.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mr. McSweeny, as he
stood at his door to bow adieu, "you will
harvest when you get a little further west?"</p>

<p>That afternoon I walked miles and miles
through rough country, and put up with a
friendly farmer named John Humphrey.
He had children like little golden doves, and
a most hard-working wife. The man had
harvested and travelled eight years in the
west before he had settled down. He told
me all about it. Until late that night he told
me endless fascinating stories upon the
theme of that free man's land ahead of me.
If he had not had those rosy babies to anchor
him, he would have picked up and gone
along, and argued down my rule to travel
alone.</p>

<p>Because he had been a man of the road
there was a peculiar feeling of understanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in the air. They were people of much
natural refinement. I was the more grateful
for their bread when I considered that
when I came upon them at sunset they were
working together in the field. There was
not a hand to help. How could they be so
happy and seem so blest? Their day was
nearer sixteen than eight hours long. I felt
deathly ashamed to eat their bread. I told
them so, with emphasis. But the mother
said, "We always takes in them that asks,
and nobody never done us no harm yet."</p>

<p>That night was a turning point with me.
In reply to a certain question I said: "<i>Yes.
I am going west harvesting.</i>"</p>

<p>I asked the veteran traveller to tell me the
best place to harvest. He was sitting on
the floor pulling the children's toes, and having
a grand time. He drew himself up into
a sort of oracular knot, with his chin on his
knees, and gesticulated with his pipe.</p>

<p>"Go straight west," he said, "to Great
Bend, Barton County, Kansas, the banner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
wheat county of the United States. Arrive
about July fifth. Walk to the public square.
Walk two miles north. Look around. You
will see nothing but wheat fields, and farmers
standing on the edge of the road crying
into big red handkerchiefs. Ask the first
man for work. He will stop crying and
give it to you. Wages will be two dollars
and a half a day, and keep. You will have
all you want to eat and a clean blanket in
the hay."</p>

<p>I have resolved to harvest at Great Bend.</p>

<small><i>Walking into Kansas</i></small></h2>


<p>It has been raining quite a little. The
roads are so muddy I have to walk the
ties. Keeping company with the railroad is
almost a habit. While this shower passes I
write in the station at Stillwell, Kansas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 14, 1912.</span> I have crossed the mystic
border. I have left Earth. I have entered
Wonderland. Though I am still east
of the geographical centre of the United
States, in every spiritual sense I am in the
West. This morning I passed the stone
mile-post that marks the beginning of
Kansas.</p>

<p>I went over the border and encountered&mdash;what
do you think? Wild strawberries!
Lo, where the farmer had cut the weeds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
between the road and the fence, the gentle
fruits revealed themselves, growing in the
shadow down between the still-standing
weeds. They shine out in a red line that
stretches on and on, and a man has to resolve
to stop eating several times. Just as
he thinks he has conquered desire the line
gets dazzlingly red again.</p>

<p>The berries grow at the end of a slender
stalk, clustered six in a bunch. One gathers
them by the stems, in bouquets, as it were,
and eats off the fruit like taffy off a stick.</p>

<p>I was gathering buckets of cherries for a
farmer's wife yesterday. This morning after
the strawberries had mitigated I encountered
a bush of raspberries, and then hedges
on hedges of mulberries both white and red.
The white mulberries are the sweetest. If
this is the wild West, give me more. There
are many varieties of trees, and they are
thick as in the East. The people seem to
grow more cordial. I was eating mulberries
outside the yard of a villager. He asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
me in where the eating was better. And
then he told me the town scandal, while I
had my dessert.</p>

<p>A day or so ago I hoed corn all morning
for my dinner. This I did cheerfully, considering
I had been given a good breakfast
at that farm for nothing. I feel that two
good meals are worth about a morning's
work anyway. And then I had company.
The elderly owner of the place hoed along
with me. He saved the country, by preaching
to me the old fashioned high tariff gospel,
and I saved it by preaching to him the
new fashioned Gospel of Beauty. Meanwhile
the corn was hoed. Then we went in
and ate the grandest of dinners. That
house was notable for having on its walls
really artistic pictures, not merely respectable
pictures, nor yet seed-catalogue advertisements.</p>

<p>That night, in passing through a village,
I glimpsed a man washing his dishes in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
rear of a blacksmith shop. I said to myself:
"Ah ha! Somebody keeping bach."</p>

<p>I knew I was welcome. There is no fear
of the stranger in such a place, for there are
no ladies to reassure or propitiate. Permission
to sleep on the floor was granted as soon
as asked. I spread out <i>The Kansas City
Star</i>, which is a clean sheet, put my verses
under my head for a pillow and was content.
Next morning the sun was in my eyes.
There was the odor of good fried bacon in
the air.</p>

<p>"Git up and eat a snack, pardner," said
my friend the blacksmith. And while I ate
he told me the story of his life.</p>

<p>I had an amusing experience at the town
of Belton. I had given an entertainment
at the hotel on the promise of a night's lodging.
I slept late. Over my transom came
the breakfast-table talk. "That was a hot
entertainment that young bum gave us last
night," said one man. "He ought to get to
work, the dirty lazy loafer," said another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The schoolmaster spoke up in an effort
not to condescend to his audience: "He is
evidently a fraud. I talked to him a long
time after the entertainment. The pieces
he recited were certainly not his own. I have
read some of them somewhere. It is too
easy a way to get along, especially when
the man is as able to work as this one. Of
course in the old days literary men used to
be obliged to do such things. But it isn't
at all necessary in the Twentieth Century.
Real poets are highly paid." Another spoke
up: "I don't mind a fake, but he is a rotten
reciter, anyhow. If he had said one
more I would have just walked right out.
You noticed ol' Mis' Smith went home after
that piece about the worms." Then came the
landlord's voice: "After the show was over
I came pretty near not letting him have his
room. All I've got to say is he don't get
any breakfast."</p>

<p>I dressed, opened the doorway serenely,
and strolled past the table, smiling with all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the ease of a minister at his own church-social.
In my most ornate manner I thanked
the landlord and landlady for their extreme
kindness. I assumed that not one of the gentle-folk
had intended to have me hear their
analysis. 'Twas a grand exit. Yet, in plain
language, these people "got my goat." I
have struggled with myself all morning, almost
on the point of ordering a marked copy
of a magazine sent to that smart schoolmaster.
"<i>Evidently a fraud!</i>" Indeed!</p>

<p>"Goin' wes' harvesin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I think I will harvest when I
get to Great Bend."</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">June 18, 1912.</span> Approaching Emporia.
I am sitting in the hot sun by the Santa Fé
tracks, after two days of walking those
tracks in the rain. I am near a queer little
Mexican house built of old railroad ties.</p>

<p>I had had two sticks of candy begged
from a grocer for breakfast. I was keeping
warm by walking fast. Because of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
muddy roads and the sheets of rain coming
down it was impossible to leave the tracks.
It was almost impossible to make speed since
the ballast underfoot was almost all of it
big rattling broken stone. I had walked
that Santa Fé railroad a day and a half in
the drizzle and downpour. It was a little
past noon, and my scanty inner fuel was
almost used up. I dared not stop a minute
now, lest I catch cold. There was no station
in sight ahead. When the mists lifted I saw
that the tracks went on and on, straight west
to the crack of doom, not even a water-tank
in sight. The mists came down, then lifted
once more, and, as though I were Childe
Roland, I suddenly saw a shack to the right,
in dimensions about seven feet each way.
It was mostly stove-pipe, and that pipe was
pouring out enough smoke to make three of
Aladdin's Jinns. I presume some one heard
me whistling. The little door opened. Two
period heads popped out, "Come in, you slab-sided
hobo," they yelled affectionately. "Come in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and get dry." And so my heart was made
suddenly light after a day and a half of
hard whistling.</p>

<p>At the inside end of that busy smoke-stack
was a roaring redhot stove about as
big as a hat. It had just room enough on
top for three steaming coffee cans at a time.
There were four white men with their chins
on their knees completely occupying the
floor of one side of the mansion, and four
Mexicans filled the other. Every man was
hunched up to take as little room as possible.
It appeared that my only chance was
to move the tins and sit on the stove. But
one Mexican sort of sat on another Mexican
and the new white man was accommodated.
These fellows were a double-section gang,
for the track is double all along here.</p>

<p>I dried out pretty quick. The men began
to pass up the coffee off the stove. It
strangled and blistered me, it was so hot.
The men were almost to the bottom of the
food sections of their buckets and were beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to throw perfectly good sandwiches
and extra pieces of pie through the door.
I said that if any man had anything to throw
away would he just wait till I stepped outside
so I could catch it. They handed me
all I could ever imagine a man eating. It
rained and rained and rained, and I ate till
I could eat no more. One man gave me for
dessert the last half of his cup of stewed
raisins along with his own spoon. Good
raisins they were, too. A Mexican urged
upon me some brown paper and cigarette
tobacco. I was sorry I did not smoke. The
men passed up more and more hot coffee.</p>

<p>That coffee made me into a sort of thermos
bottle. On the strength of it I walked all
afternoon through sheets and cataracts.
When dark came I slept in wet clothes in a
damp blanket in the hay of a windy livery stable
without catching cold.</p>

<p>Now it is morning. The sky is reasonably
clear, the weather is reasonably warm, but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
am no longer a thermos bottle, no, no. I am
sitting on the hottest rock I can find, letting
the sun go through my bones. The coffee
in me has turned at last to ice and snow.
Emporia, the Athens of America, is just
ahead. Oh, for a hot bath and a clean shirt!</p>

<p>A mad dog tried to bite me yesterday
morning, when I made a feeble attempt to
leave the track. When I was once back on
the ties, he seemed afraid and would not
come closer. His bark was the ghastliest
thing I ever heard. As for his bite, he did
not get quite through my shoe-heel.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Emporia, Kansas, June 19, 1912.</span> On
inquiring at the Emporia General Delivery
for mail, I found your letter telling
me to call upon your friend Professor Kerr.
He took my sudden appearance most kindly,
and pardoned my battered attire and the
mud to the knees. After a day in his house
I am ready to go on, dry and feasted and
warm and clean. The professor's help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
seemed to come in just in time. I was a most
weary creature.</p>

<p>Thinking it over this morning, the bathtub
appears to be the first outstanding advantage
the cultured man has over the half-civilized.
Quite often the folk with swept
houses and decent cooking who have given
my poems discriminating attention, who
have given me good things to eat, forget,
even when they entertain him overnight,
that the stranger would like to soak himself
thoroughly. Many of the working people
seem to keep fairly clean with the washpan
as their principal ally. But the tub is indispensable
to the mendicant in the end, unless
he is walking through a land of crystal
waterfalls, like North Georgia.</p>

<p>I am an artificial creature at last, dependent,
after all, upon modern plumbing. 'Tis,
perhaps, not a dignified theme, but I retired
to the professor's bathroom and washed off
the entire State of Missouri and the eastern
counties of Kansas, and did a deal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
laundry work on the sly. This last was not
openly confessed to the professor, but he
might have guessed, I was so cold on the
front porch that night.</p>

<p>I shall not soon lose the memory of this
the first day of emergence from the strait
paths of St. Francis, this first meeting, since
I left Springfield, with a person on whom I
had a conventional social claim. I had forgotten
what the delicacy of a cultured welcome
would be like. The professor's table
was a marvel to me. I was astonished to
discover there were such fine distinctions in
food and linen. And for all my troubadour
profession, I had almost forgotten there
were such distinctions in books. I have
hardly seen one magazine since I left you.
The world where I have been moving reads
nothing but newspapers. It is confusing to
bob from one world to the other, to zig-zag
across the social dead-line. I sat in the professor's
library a very mixed-up person, feeling
I could hardly stay a minute, yet too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
heavy-footed to stir an inch, and immensely
grateful and relaxed.</p>

<p>Sooner or later I am going to step up into
the rarefied civilized air once too often and
stay there in spite of myself. I shall get a
little too fond of the china and old silver,
and forget the fields. Books and teacups
and high-brow conversations are awfully insinuating
things, if you give them time to
be. One gets along somehow, and pleasure
alternates with pain, and the sum is the joy
of life, while one is below. But to quit is
like coming up to earth after deep-sea diving
in a heavy suit. One scarcely realizes he has
been under heavier-than-air pressure, and
has been fighting off great forces, till he has
taken off his diving helmet, as it were. And
yet there is a baffling sense of futility in the
restful upper air. I remember it once, long
ago, in emerging in Warren, Ohio, and once
in emerging in Macon, Georgia:&mdash;the feeling
that the upper world is all tissue paper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that the only choice a real man can make is
to stay below with the great forces of life
forever, even though he be a tramp&mdash;the
feeling that, to be a little civilized, we sacrifice
enormous powers and joys. For all
I was so tired and so very grateful to the
professor, I felt like a bull in a china shop.
I should have been out in the fields, eating
grass.</p>

<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Sunday Morning, June 23, 1912.</span> I am
writing on the top of a pile of creosote-soaked
ties between the Santa Fé tracks and
the trail that runs parallel to the tracks.
Florence, Kansas, is somewhere ahead.</p>

<p>In the East the railroads and machinery
choke the land to death and it was there I
made my rule against them. But the farther
West I go the more the very life of the
country seems to depend upon them. I suppose,
though, that some day, even out West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
here, the rule against the railroad will be a
good rule.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let me say that my Ruskinian
prejudices are temporarily overcome by the
picturesqueness and efficiency of the Santa
Fé. It is double-tracked, and every four
miles is kept in order by a hand-car crew
that is spinning back and forth all the time.
The air seems to be full of hand-cars.</p>

<p>Walking in a hurry to make a certain
place by nightfall I have become acquainted
with these section hands, and, most delightful
to relate, have ridden in their iron conveyances,
putting my own back into the
work. Half or three-fourths of the employees
are Mexicans who are as ornamental
in the actual landscape as they are in a Remington
drawing. These Mexicans are tractable
serfs of the Santa Fé. If there were
enough miles of railroad in Mexico to keep
all the inhabitants busy on section, perhaps
the internal difficulties could be ended.
These peons live peacefully next to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
tracks in houses built by the company from
old ties. The ties are placed on end, side by
side, with plaster in the cracks, on a tiny
oblong two-room plan. There is a little
roofed court between the rooms. A farmer
told me that the company tried Greek serfs
for a while, but they made trouble for outsiders
and murdered each other.</p>

<p>The road is busy as busy can be. Almost
any time one can see enormous freight-trains
rolling by or mile-a-minute passenger trains.
Gates are provided for each farmer's
right of way. I was told by an exceptional
Mexican with powers of speech that the efficient
dragging of the wagon-roads, especially
the "New Santa Fé Trail" that follows
the railroad, is owing to the missionary
work of King, the split-log drag man, who
was employed to go up and down this land
agitating his hobby.</p>

<p>When the weather is good, touring automobiles
whiz past. They have pennants
showing they are from Kansas City, Emporia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
New York or Chicago. They have
camping canvas and bedding on the back
seats of the car, or strapped in the rear.
They are on camping tours to Colorado
Springs and the like pleasure places. Some
few avow they are going to the coast. About
five o'clock in the evening some man making
a local trip is apt to come along alone. He
it is that wants the other side of the machine
weighed down. He it is that will offer me a
ride and spin me along from five to twenty-five
miles before supper. This delightful
use that may be made of an automobile in
rounding out a day's walk has had something
to do with mending my prejudice
against it, despite the grand airs of the tourists
that whirl by at midday. I still maintain
that the auto is a carnal institution, to
be shunned by the truly spiritual, but there
are times when I, for one, get tired of being
spiritual.</p>

<p>Much of the country east of Emporia is
hilly and well-wooded and hedged like Missouri.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
But now I am getting into the range
region. Yesterday, after several miles of
treeless land that had never known the
plough, I said to myself: "Now I am really
West." And my impression was reinforced
when I reached a grand baronial establishment
called "Clover Hill Ranch." It was
flanked by the houses of the retainers. In
the foreground and a little to the side was
the great stone barn for the mules and horses.
Back on the little hill, properly introduced
by ceremonious trees, was the ranch house
itself. And before it was my lord on his
ranching charger. The aforesaid lord
created quite an atmosphere of lordliness as
he refused work in the alfalfa harvest to a
battered stranger who bowed too low and
begged too hard, perhaps. On the porch
was my lady, feeding bread and honey to the
beautiful young prince of the place.</p>

<p>I have not yet reached the wheat belt.
Since the alfalfa harvest is on here, I shall
try for that a bit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Sunday Afternoon, June 30, 1912.</span> In
the spare room of a Mennonite farmer, who
lives just inside the wheat belt.</p>

<p>This is going to be a long Sunday afternoon;
so make up your minds for a long letter.
I did not get work in the alfalfa. Yet
there is news. I have been staying a week
with this Mennonite family shocking wheat
for them, though I am not anywhere near
Great Bend.</p>

<p>Before I tell you of the harvest, I must
tell you of these Mennonites. They are a
dear people. I have heard from their reverent
lips the name of their founder, Menno
Simonis, who was born about the time of
Columbus and Luther and other such
worthies. They are as opposed to carnal
literature as I am to tailor-made clothes,
and I hold they are perfectly correct in allowing
no fashion magazines in the house.
Such modern books as they read deal with
practical local philanthropies and great international
mission movements, and their interdenominational
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
feelings for all Christendom
are strong. Yet they hold to their ancient
verities, and antiquity broods over their
meditations.</p>

<p>For instance I found in their bookcase an
endless dialogue epic called <i>The Wandering
Soul</i>, in which this soul, seeking mainly for
information, engages in stilted conversation
with Adam, Noah, and Simon Cleophas.
Thereby the Wandering Soul is informed
as to the orthodox history and chronology of
the world from the Creation to the destruction
of Jerusalem. The wood-cuts are devotional.
They are worth walking to Kansas
to see. The book had its third translation
into Pennsylvania English in 1840,
but several American editions had existed
in German before that, and several German
editions in Germany. It was originally
written in the Dutch language and was popular
among the Mennonites there. But it
looks as if it was printed by Adam to last
forever and scare bad boys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us go to meeting. All the women are
on their own side of the aisle. All of them
have a fairly uniform Quakerish sort of
dress of no prescribed color. In front are
the most pious, who wear a black scoop-bonnet.
Some have taken this off, and show
the inevitable "prayer-covering" underneath.
It is the plainest kind of a lace-cap, awfully
coquettish on a pretty head. It is intended
to mortify the flesh, and I suppose it <i>is</i> unbecoming
to <i>some</i> women.</p>

<p>All the scoop-bonnets are not black.
Toward the middle of the church, behold a
cream-satin, a soft gray, a dull moon-gold.
One young woman, moved, I fear, by the
devil, turns and looks across the aisle at us.
An exceedingly demure bow is tied all too
sweetly under the chin, in a decorous butterfly
style. Fie! fie! Is this mortifying the
flesh? And I note with pain that the black
bonnets grow fewer and fewer toward the
rear of the meeting house.</p>

<p>Here come the children, with bobbing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
headgear of every color of the rainbow, yet
the same scoop-pattern still. They have been
taking little walks and runs between Sunday-school
and church, and are all flushed
and panting. But I would no more criticise
the color of their headgear than the color in
their faces. Some of them squeeze in among
the black rows in front and make piety reasonable.
But we noted by the door as they
entered something that both the church and
the world must abhor. Seated as near to the
men's side as they can get, with a mixture
of shame and defiance in their faces, are certain
daughters of the Mennonites who insist
on dressing after the fashions that come
from Paris and Kansas City and Emporia.
By the time the rumors of what is proper in
millinery have reached this place they are a
disconcerting mixture of cherries, feathers
and ferns. And somehow there are too many
mussy ribbons on the dresses.</p>

<p>We can only guess how these rebels must
suffer under the concentrated silent prayers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the godly. Poor honest souls! they take
to this world's vain baggage and overdo it.
Why do they not make up their minds to
serve the devil sideways, like that sly puss
with the butterfly bow?</p>

<p>On the men's side of the house the division
on dress is more acute. The Holiness
movement, the doctrine of the Second Blessing
that has stirred many rural Methodist
groups, has attacked the Mennonites also.
Those who dispute for this new ism of sanctification
leave off their neckties as a sign.
Those that retain their neckties, satisfied
with what Menno Simonis taught, have a
hard time remaining in a state of complete
calm. The temptation to argue the matter
is almost more than flesh can bear.</p>

<p>But, so far as I could discover, there was
no silent prayer over the worst lapse of these
people. What remains of my Franciscan
soul was hurt to discover that the buggy-shed
of the meeting-house was full of automobiles.
And to meet a Mennonite on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
road without a necktie, his wife in the blackest
of bonnets, honking along in one of those
glittering brazen machines, almost shakes
my confidence in the Old Jerusalem Gospel.</p>

<p>Yet let me not indulge in disrespect.
Every spiritual warfare must abound in its
little ironies. They are keeping their rule
against finery as well as I am keeping mine
against the railroad. And they have their
own way of not being corrupted by money.
Their ministry is unsalaried. Their preachers
are sometimes helpers on the farms,
sometimes taken care of outright, the same
as I am.</p>

<p>As will later appear, despite some inconsistencies,
the Mennonites have a piety as
literal as any to be found on the earth. Since
they are German there is no lack of thought
in their system. I attended one of their
quarterly conferences and I have never
heard better discourses on the distinctions
between the four gospels. The men who
spoke were scholars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mennonites make it a principle to ignore
politics, and are non-resistants in war.
I have read in the life of one of their heroes
what a terrible time his people had in the
Shenandoah valley in the days of Sheridan....
Three solemn tracts are here on my
dresser. The first is against church organs,
embodying a plea for simplicity and the
spending of such money on local benevolences
and world-wide missions. The tract
aptly compares the church-organ to the Thibetan
prayer-wheel, and later to praying by
phonograph. A song is a prayer to them,
and they sing hymns and nothing but hymns
all week long.</p>

<p>The next tract is on non-conformity to
this world, and insists our appearance should
indicate our profession, and that fashions
drive the poor away from the church. It
condemns jewels and plaiting of the hair,
etc., and says that such things stir up a
wicked and worldly lust in the eyes of youth.
This tract goes so far as to put worldly pictures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
under the ban. Then comes another,
headed Bible Teaching on Dress. It goes
on to show that every true Christian, especially
that vain bird, the female, should wear
something like the Mennonite uniform to
indicate the line of separation from "the
World." I have a good deal of sympathy
for all this, for indeed is it not briefly comprehended
in my own rule: "Carry no baggage"?</p>

<p>These people celebrate communion every
half year, and at the same time they practise
the ritual of washing the feet. Since Isadora
Duncan has rediscovered the human
foot æsthetically, who dares object to it in
ritual? It is all a question of what we
are trained to expect. Certainly these people
are respecters of the human foot and not
ashamed to show it. Next to the way their
women have of making a dash to find their
gauzy prayer-covering, which they put on
for grace at table and Bible-lesson before
breakfast, their most striking habit is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
way both men and women go about in very
clean bare feet after supper. Next to this
let me note their resolve to have no profane
hour whatsoever. When not actually at
work they sit and sing hymns, each Christian
on his own hook as he has leisure.</p>

<p>My first evening among these dear
strangers I was sitting alone by the front
door, looking out on the wheat. I was
thrilled to see the fairest member of the
household enter, not without grace and dignity.
Her prayer covering was on her head,
her white feet were shining like those of
Nicolette and her white hymn-book was in
her hand. She ignored me entirely. She
was rapt in trance. She sat by the window
and sang through the book, looking straight
at a rose in the wall-paper.</p>

<p>I lingered there, reading <i>The Wandering
Soul</i> just as oblivious of her presence as she
was of mine. Oh, no; there was no art in
the selection of her songs! I remember one
which was to this effect:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Don't let it be said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Too late, too late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To enter that Golden Gate.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be ready, for soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time will come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To enter that Golden Gate."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the whole she had as much right to
plunk down and sing hymns out of season
as I have to burst in and quote poetry to
peaceful and unprotected households.</p>

<p>I would like to insert a discourse here on
the pleasure and the naturalness and the humanness
of testifying to one's gospel whatever
that gospel may be, barefooted or golden-slippered
or iron-shod. The best we
may win in return may be but a kindly
smile. We may never make one convert.
Still the duty of testifying remains, and
is enjoined by the invisible powers and
makes for the health of the soul. This Mennonite
was a priestess of her view of the
truth and comes of endless generations of
such snow-footed apostles. I presume the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
sect ceased to enlarge when the Quakers
ceased to thrive, but I make my guess that
it does not crumble as fast as the Quakers,
having more German stolidity.</p>

<p>Let me again go forward, testifying to
my particular lonely gospel in the face of
such pleasant smiles and incredulous questions
as may come. I wish I could start a
sturdy sect like old Menno Simonis did.
They should dress as these have done, and
be as stubborn and rigid in their discipline.
They should farm as these have done, but
on reaching the point where the Mennonite
buys the automobile, that money and energy
should go into the making of cross-roads
palaces for the people, golden as the harvest
field, and disciplined well-parked villages,
good as a psalm, and cities fair as a Mennonite
lady in her prayer-covering, delicate
and noble as Athens the unforgotten, the
divine.</p>

<p>The Mennonite doctrine of non-participation
in war or politics leads them to confine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
their periodic literature to religious journals
exclusively, plus <i>The Drover's Journal</i> to
keep them up to date on the prices of farm-products.
There is only one Mennonite political
event, the coming of Christ to judge
the earth. Of that no man knoweth the
day or the hour. We had best be prepared
and not play politics or baseball or anything.
Just keep unspotted and harvest the
wheat.</p>

<p>"Goin' wes' harvesin'?"</p>

<p>I have harvested, thank you. Four days
and a half I have shocked wheat in these
prayer-consecrated fields that I see even now
from my window. And I have good hard
dollars in my pocket, which same dollars are
against my rules.</p>

<p>I will tell you of the harvest in the next
letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br />

<small><i>In Kansas: The First Harvest</i></small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Monday Afternoon, July 1, 1912.</span> A
little west of Newton, Kansas. In the public
library of a village whose name I forget.</p>

<p>Here is the story of how I came to harvest.
I was by chance taking a short respite
from the sunshine, last Monday noon, on
the porch of the Mennonite farmer. I had
had dinner further back. But the good folk
asked me to come in and have dessert anyway.
It transpired that one of the two
harvest hands was taking his farewell meal.
He was obliged to fill a contract to work
further West, a contract made last year. I
timidly suggested I might take his place.
To my astonishment I was engaged at once.
This fellow was working for two dollars a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
day, but I agreed to $1.75, seeing my predecessor
was a skilled man and twice as big
as I was. My wages, as I discovered, included
three rich meals, and a pretty spare
room to sleep in, and a good big bucket
to bathe in nightly.</p>

<p>I anticipate history at this point by telling
how at the end of the week my wages looked
as strange to me as a bunch of unexpected
ducklets to a hen. They were as curious to
contemplate as a group of mischievous nieces
who have come to spend the day with their
embarrassed, fluttering maiden aunt.</p>

<p>I took my wages to Newton, and spent
all on the vanities of this life. First the
grandest kind of a sombrero, so I shall not
be sunstruck in the next harvest-field, which
I narrowly escaped in this. Next, the most
indestructible of corduroys. Then I had
my shoes re-soled and bought a necktie that
was like the oriflamme of Navarre, and attended
to several other points of vanity. I
started out again, dead broke and happy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
If I work hereafter I can send most all my
wages home, for I am now in real travelling
costume.</p>

<p>But why linger over the question of wages
till I show I earned those wages?</p>

<p>Let me tell you of a typical wheat-harvesting
day. The field is two miles from the
house. We make preparations for a twelve-hour
siege. Halters and a barrel of water
and a heap of alfalfa for the mules, binder-twine
and oil for the reaper and water-jugs
for us are loaded into the spring wagon.
Two mules are hitched in front, two are led
behind. The new reaper was left in the field
yesterday. We make haste. We must be
at work by the time the dew dries. The
four mules are soon hitched to the reaper
and proudly driven into the wheat by the son
of the old Mennonite. This young fellow
carries himself with proper dignity as heir
of the farm. He is a credit to the father.
He will not curse the mules, though those
animals forget their religion sometimes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
act after the manner of their kind. The
worst he will do will be to call one of them
an old cow. I suppose when he is vexed
with a cow he calls it an old mule. My
other companion is a boy of nineteen from a
Mennonite community in Pennsylvania. He
sets me a pace. Together we build the
sheaves into shocks, of eight or ten sheaves
each, put so they will not be shaken by an
ordinary Kansas wind. The wind has been
blowing nearly all the time at a rate which
in Illinois would mean a thunderstorm in
five minutes, and sometimes the clouds loom
in the thunderstorm way, yet there is not a
drop of rain, and the clouds are soon gone.</p>

<p>In the course of the week the boy and I
have wrestled with heavy ripe sheaves,
heavier green sheaves, sheaves full of Russian
thistles and sheaves with the string off.
The boy, as he sings <i>The day-star hath risen</i>,
twists a curious rope of straw and reties the
loose bundles with one turn of the hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
I try, but cannot make the knot. Once all
sheaves were so bound.</p>

<p>Much of the wheat must be cut heavy and
green because there is a liability to sudden
storms or hail that will bury it in mud, or
soften the ground and make it impossible
to drag the reaper, or hot winds that suddenly
ripen the loose grain and shake it
into the earth. So it is an important matter
to get the wheat out when it is anywhere
near ready. I found that two of the girls
were expecting to take the place of the departing
hand, if I had not arrived.</p>

<p>The Mennonite boy picked up two sheaves
to my one at the beginning of the week.
To-day I learn to handle two at a time and
he immediately handles three at a time. He
builds the heart of the sheaf. Then we add
the outside together. He is always marching
ahead and causing me to feel ashamed.</p>

<p>The Kansas grasshopper makes himself
friendly. He bites pieces out of the back
of my shirt the shape and size of the ace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of spades. Then he walks into the door he
has made and loses himself. Then he has
to be helped out, in one way or another.</p>

<p>The old farmer, too stiff for work, comes
out on his dancing pony and rides behind the
new reaper. This reaper was bought only
two days ago and he beams with pride upon
it. It seems that he and his son almost
swore, trying to tinker the old one. The
farmer looks with even more pride upon
the field, still a little green, but mostly
golden. He dismounts and tests the grain,
threshing it out in his hand, figuring the
average amount in several typical heads. He
stands off, and is guilty of an æsthetic thrill.
He says of the sea of gold: "I wish I could
have a photograph of that." (O eloquent
word, for a Mennonite!) Then he plays at
building half a dozen shocks, then goes home
till late in the afternoon. We three are
again masters of the field.</p>

<p>We are in a level part of Kansas, not a
rolling range as I found it further east.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
The field is a floor. Hedges gradually faded
from the landscape in counties several days'
journey back, leaving nothing but unbroken
billows to the horizon. But the hedges have
been resumed in this region. Each time
round the enormous field we stop at a break
in the line of those untrimmed old thorn-trees.
Here we rest a moment and drink
from the water-jug. To keep from getting
sunstruck I profanely waste the water,
pouring it on my head, and down my neck
to my feet. I came to this farm wearing
a derby, and have had to borrow a slouch
with a not-much-wider rim from the farmer.
It was all the extra headgear available in
this thrifty region. Because of that not-much-wider
rim my face is sunburned all
over every day. I have not yet received my
wages to purchase my sombrero.</p>

<p>As we go round the field, the Mennonite
boy talks religion, or is silent. I have caught
the spirit of the farm, and sing all the hymn-tunes
I can remember. Sometimes the wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
turns hot. Perspiration cannot keep up with
evaporation. Our skins are dry as the
dryest stubble. Then we stand and wait for
a little streak of cool wind. It is pretty
sure to come in a minute. "That's a nice
air," says the boy, and gets to work. Once
it was so hot all three of us stopped five
minutes by the hedge. Then it was I told
them the story of the hens I met just west
of Emporia.</p>

<p>I had met ten hens walking single-file into
the town of Emporia. I was astonished to
meet educated hens. Each one was swearing.
I would not venture, I added, to repeat
what they said.</p>

<p><i>Not a word from the Mennonites.</i></p>

<p>I continued in my artless way, showing
how I stopped the next to the last hen,
though she was impatient to go on. I inquired
"Where are you all travelling?" She
said "To Emporia." And so I asked, "Why
are you swearing so?" She answered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"Don't you know about the Sunday-school
picnic?" I paused in my story.</p>

<p><i>No word from the Mennonites. One of
them rose rather impatiently.</i></p>

<p>I poured some water on my head and continued:
"I stopped the last hen. I asked:
"Why are you swearing, sister? And what
about the picnic?" She replied: "These Emporia
people are going to give a Sunday-school
picnic day after to-morrow. Meantime
all us hens have to lay devilled eggs."</p>

<p>"We do not laugh at jokes about swearing,"
said the Mennonite driver, and climbed
back on to his reaper. My partner strode
solemnly out into the sun and began to pile
sheaves.</p>

<p>Each round we study our shadows on the
stubble more closely, thrilled with the feeling
that noon creeps on. And now, up the
road we see a bit of dust and a rig. No, it
is not the woman we are looking for, but
a woman with supplies for other harvesters.
We work on and on, while four disappointing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
rigs go by. At last appears a sunbonnet
we know. Our especial Mennonite maid
is sitting quite straight on the edge of the
seat and holding the lines almost on a level
with her chin. She drives through the field
toward us. We motion her to the gap in the
hedge.</p>

<p>We unhitch, and lead the mules to the gap,
where she joins us. With much high-minded
expostulation the men try to show the
mules they should eat alfalfa and not hedge-thorns.
The mules are at last tied out in the
sun to a wheel of the wagon, away from
temptation, with nothing but alfalfa near
them.</p>

<p>The meal is spread with delicacy, yet there
is a heap of it. With a prayer of thanksgiving,
sometimes said by Tilly, sometimes
by one of the men, we begin to eat. To a
man in a harvest-field a square meal is more
thrilling than a finely-acted play.</p>

<p>The thrill goes not only to the toes and the
finger-tips, but to the utmost ramifications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of the spirit. Men indoors in offices, whose
bodies actually require little, cannot think
of eating enormously without thinking of
sodden overeating, with condiments to
rouse, and heavy meats and sweets to lull
the flabby body till the last faint remnants
of appetite have departed and the man is a
monument of sleepy gluttony.</p>

<p>Eating in a harvest field is never so.
Every nerve in the famished body calls frantically
for reinforcements. And the nerves
and soul of a man are strangely alert together.
All we ate for breakfast turned to
hot ashes in our hearts at eleven o'clock. I
sing of the body and of the eternal soul,
revived again! To feel life actually throbbing
back into one's veins, life immense in
passion, pulse and power, is not over-eating.</p>

<p>Tilly has brought us knives, and no forks.
It would have been more appropriate if we
had eaten from the ends of swords. We are
finally recuperated from the fevers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
morning and almost strong enough for the
long, long afternoon fight with the sun.
Fresh water is poured from a big glittering
can into the jugs we have sucked dry. Tilly
reloads the buggy and is gone. After another
sizzling douse of water without and
within, our long afternoon pull commences.</p>

<p>The sun has become like a roaring lion,
and we wrestle with the sheaves as though
we had him by the beard. The only thing
that keeps up my nerve in the dizziness is
the remembrance of the old Mennonite's
proverb at breakfast that as long as a man
can eat and sweat he is safe. My hands inside
my prickling gloves seem burning off.
The wheat beards there are like red-hot
needles. But I am still sweating a little in
the chest, and the Mennonite boy is cheerfully
singing:</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When I behold the wondrous cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the Prince of Glory died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My richest gain I count but loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pour contempt on all my pride."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Two-thirds round the field, methinks the jig
is up. Then the sun is hidden by a friend of
ours in the sky, just the tiniest sort of a
cloud and we march on down the rows. The
merciful little whiff of dream follows the
sun for half an hour.</p>

<p>The most terrible heat is at half-past two.
Somehow we pull through till four o'clock.
Then we say to ourselves: "We can stand
this four-o'clock heat, because we have stood
it hotter."</p>

<p>'Tis a grim matter of comparison. We
speed up a little and trot a little as the sun
reaches the top of the western hedge. A bit
later the religious hired man walks home to
do the chores. I sing down the rows by
myself. It is glorious to work now. The
endless reiterations of the day have developed
a certain dancing rhythm in one's
nerves, one is intoxicated with his own weariness
and the conceit that comes with seizing
the sun by the mane, like Sampson.</p>

<p>It is now that the sun gracefully acknowledges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
his defeat. He shows through the
hedge as a great blur, that is all. Then he
becomes a mist-wrapped golden mountain
that some fairy traveller might climb in enchanted
shoes. This sun of ours is no longer
an enemy, but a fantasy, a vision and a
dream.</p>

<p>Now the elderly proprietor is back on his
dancing pony. He is following the hurrying
reaper in a sort of ceremonial fashion,
delighted to see the wheat go down so fast.
At last this particular field is done. We
finish with a comic-tragedy. Some little
rabbits scoot, panic-stricken, from the last
few yards of still-standing grain. The old
gentleman on horseback and his son afoot
soon out-man&oelig;uvre the lively creatures. We
have rabbit for supper at the sacrifice of
considerable Mennonite calm.</p>

<p>It was with open rejoicing on the part
of all that we finished the field nearest the
house, the last one, by Saturday noon. The
boy and I had our own special thrill in catching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
up with the reaper, which had passed by
us so often in our rounds. As the square
in mid-field grows smaller the reaper has to
turn oftener, and turning uses up much
more time than at first appears.</p>

<p>The places where the armies of wheat-sheaves
are marshalled are magic places,
despite their sweat and dust. There is nothing
small in the panorama. All the lines of
the scene are epic. The binder-twine is invisible,
and has not altered the eternal classic
form of the sheaf. There is a noble dignity
and ease in the motion of a new reaper on a
level field. A sturdy Mennonite devotee
marching with a great bundle of wheat under
each arm and reaching for a third makes
a picture indeed, an essay on sunshine beyond
the brush of any impressionist. Each
returning day while riding to the field, when
one has a bit of time to dream, one feels
these things. One feels also the essentially
patriarchal character of the harvest. One
thinks of the Book of Ruth, and the Jewish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
feasts of ingathering. All the new Testament
parables ring in one's ears, parables of
sowing and reaping, of tares and good grain,
of Bread and of Leaven and the story of
the Disciples plucking corn. As one looks
on the half-gathered treasure he thinks on
the solemn words: "For the Bread of God
is that which cometh down out of Heaven
and giveth life unto the World," and the
rest of that sermon on the Bread of Life,
which has so many meanings.</p>

<p>This Sunday before breakfast, I could
fully enter into the daily prayers, that at
times had appeared merely quaint to me,
and in my heart I said "Amen" to the special
thanksgiving the patriarch lifted up for the
gift of the fruit of the land. I was happy
indeed that I had had the strength to bear
my little part in the harvest of a noble and
devout household, as well as a hand in the
feeding of the wide world.</p>

<p>What I, a stranger, have done in this
place, thirty thousand strangers are doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
just a little to the west. We poor tramps
are helping to garner that which reestablishes
the nations. If only for a little while,
we have bent our backs over the splendid
furrows, to save a shining gift that would
otherwise rot, or vanish away.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Thursday Afternoon, July Fourth,
1912.</span> In the shadow of a lonely windmill
between Raymond and Ellinwood, Kansas.</p>

<p>I arrived hot and ravenous at Raymond
about eleven <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on this glorious Independence
Day, having walked twelve miles facing
a strange wind. At first it seemed fairly
cool, because it travelled at the rate of an
express train. But it was really hot and
alkaline, and almost burnt me up. I had
had for breakfast a cooky, some raisins and
a piece of cheese, purchased with my booklet
of rhymes at a grocery. By the time I
reached Raymond I was fried and frantic.</p>

<p>The streets were deserted. I gathered
from the station-master that almost everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
had gone to the Dutch picnic in the
grove near Ellinwood. The returns for the
Johnson-Flynn fight were to be received
there beneath the trees, and a potent variety
of dry-state beverage was to flow free. The
unveracious station-master declared this beverage
was made of equal parts iron-rust,
patent medicine and rough-on-rats, added
to a barrel of brown rain-water. He appeared
to be prejudiced against it.</p>

<p>I walked down the street. Just as I had
somehow anticipated, I spied out a certain
type of man. He was alone in his restaurant
and I crouched my soul to spring. The
only man left in town is apt to be a soft-hearted
party. "Here, as sure as my name
is tramp, I will wrestle with a defenceless
fellow-being."</p>

<p>Like many a restaurant in Kansas, it was
a sort of farm-hand's Saturday night paradise.
If a man cannot loaf in a saloon he
will loaf in a restaurant. Then certain
problems of demand and supply arise according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to circumstances and circumlocutions.</p>

<p>I obtained leave for the ice-water without
wrestling. I almost emptied the tank.
Then, with due art, I offered to recite twenty
poems to the solitary man, a square meal to
be furnished at the end, if the rhymes were
sufficiently fascinating.</p>

<p>Assuming a judicial attitude on the lunch-counter
stool he put me in the arm-chair by
the ice-chest and told me to unwind myself.
As usual, I began with <i>The Proud Farmer</i>,
<i>The Illinois Village</i> and <i>The Building of
Springfield</i>, which three in series contain
my whole gospel, directly or by implication.
Then I wandered on through all sorts of
rhyme. He nodded his head like a mandarin,
at the end of each recital. Then he
began to get dinner. He said he liked my
poetry, and he was glad I came in, for he
would feel more like getting something to
eat himself. I sat on and on by the ice-chest
while he prepared a meal more heating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
than the morning wind or the smell of fire-crackers
in the street. First, for each man,
a slice of fried ham large enough for a
whole family. Then French fried potatoes
by the platterful. Then three fried eggs
apiece. There was milk with cream on top
to be poured from a big granite bucket as
we desired it. There was a can of beans
with tomato sauce. There was sweet apple-butter.
There were canned apples. There
was a pot of coffee. I moved over from the
ice-chest and we talked and ate till half-past
one. I began to feel that I was solid as an
iron man and big as a Colossus of Rhodes.
I would like to report our talk, but this letter
must end somewhere. I agreed with my
host's opinions on everything but the temperance
question. He did not believe in
<i>total</i> abstinence. On that I remained noncommittal.
Eating as I had, how could I
take a stand against my benefactor even
though the issue were the immortal one of
man's sinful weakness for drink? The ham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and ice water were going to my head as it
was. And I could have eaten more. I could
have eaten a fat Shetland pony.</p>

<p>My host explained that he also travelled
at times, but did not carry poetry. He gave
me much box-car learning. Then, curious
to relate, he dug out maps and papers, and
showed me how to take up a claim in Oregon,
a thing I did not in the least desire to
do. God bless him in basket and in store,
afoot or at home.</p>

<p>This afternoon the ham kept on frying
within me, not uncomfortably. I stopped
and drank at every windmill. Now it is
about four o'clock in the afternoon and I
am in the shadow of one more. I have found
a bottle which just fits my hip pocket which
I have washed and will use as a canteen
henceforth. When one knows he has his
drink with him, he does not get so thirsty.</p>

<p>But I have put down little to show you
the strange intoxication that has pervaded
this whole day. The inebriating character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the air and the water and the intoxication
that comes with the very sight of the wind-mills
spinning alone, and the elation that
comes with the companionship of the sun,
and the gentleness of the occasional good
Samaritans, are not easily conveyed in words.
When one's spirit is just right for this sort
of thing it all makes as good an Independence
Day as folks are having anywhere in
this United States, even at Ellinwood.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Thursday, July 5, 1912.</span> In the office
of the Ellinwood livery stable in the morning.</p>

<p>Everyone came home drunk from the
Dutch picnic last night. Ellinwood roared
and Ellinwood snorted. I reached the place
from the east just as the noisy revellers arrived
from the south.</p>

<p>Ellinwood is an old German town full of
bar-rooms, forced by the sentiment of the
dry voters in surrounding territory to turn
into restaurants, but only of late. The bar-fixtures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
are defiantly retained. Ever and
anon Ellinwood takes to the woods with
malicious intent.</p>

<p>Many of the citizens were in a mad-dog
fury because Flynn had not licked Johnson.
This town seems to be of the opinion that
that battle was important. The proprietor
of the most fashionable hotel monopolized
the 'phone on his return from the woods.
He called up everybody in town. His conversation
was always the same. "What'd
ya think of the fight?" And without waiting
for answer: "I'll bet one hundred thousand
dollars that Flynn can lick Johnson in
a fair fight. It's a disgrace to this nation
that black rascal kin lay hands on a white
man. I'll bet a hundred thousand dollars....
A hundred thousand dollars ..."
etc.</p>

<p>I sat a long time waiting for him to get
through. At last I put in my petition at
another hostelrie. This host was intoxicated,
but gentle. In exchange for what I call the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
squarest kind of a meal I recited the most
cooling verses I knew to a somewhat distracted,
rather alcoholic company of harvest
hands. First I recited a poem in praise of
Lincoln and then one in praise of the uplifting
influence of the village church. Then,
amid qualified applause, I distributed my
tracts, and retreated to this stable for the
night.</p>

<small><i>In Kansas: the Second and Third Harvest</i></small></h2>


<p>Two miles north of Great Bend. In
the heart of the greatest wheat country
in America, and in the midst of the harvest-time,
Sunday, July 7, 1912.</p>

<p>I am meditating on the ways of Destiny.
It seems to me I am here, not altogether by
chance. But just why I am here, time must
reveal.</p>

<p>Last Friday I had walked the ten miles
from Ellinwood to Great Bend by 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
I went straight to the general delivery, where
a package of tracts and two or three weeks'
mail awaited me. I read about half through
the letter-pile as I sat on a rickety bench in
the public square. Some very loud-mouthed
negroes were playing horse-shoe obstreperously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
I began to wish Flynn had whipped
Johnson. I was thinking of getting away
from there, when two white men, evidently
harvesters, sat down near me and diluted the
color scheme.</p>

<p>One man said: "Harvest-wages this week
are from two dollars and fifty cents up to
four dollars. We are experienced men and
worth three dollars and fifty cents." Then
a German farmer came and negotiated with
them in vain. He wanted to hold them down
to three dollars apiece. He had his automobile
to take his crew away that morning.</p>

<p>Then a fellow in citified clothes came to
me and asked: "Can you follow a reaper
and shock?" I said: "<i>Show me the wheat.</i>"
So far as I remember, it is the first time in
my life anyone ever hunted me out and <i>asked</i>
me to work for him. He put me into his
buggy and drove me about two miles north
to this place, just the region John Humphrey
told me to find, though he did not
specify this farm. I was offered $2.50 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
keep, as the prophet foretold. The man
who drove me out has put his place this year
into the hands of a tenant who is my direct
boss. I may not be able to last out, but all
is well so far. I have made an acceptable
hand, keeping up with the reaper by myself,
and I feel something especial awaits me.
But the reaper breaks down so often I do
not know whether I can keep up with it
without help when it begins going full-speed.</p>

<p>These people do not attend church like
the Mennonites. The tenant wanted me to
break the Sabbath and help him in the alfalfa
to-day. He suggested that neither he
nor I was so narrow-minded or superstitious
as to be a "Sunday man." Besides he
couldn't work the alfalfa at all without one
more hand. I did not tell him so, but I felt
I needed all Sunday to catch up on my
tiredness. I suspect that my refusal to violate
the Sabbath vexed him.</p>

<p>There has been a terrible row of some kind
going on behind the barn all afternoon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Maybe he is working off his vexation. At
last the tenant's wife has gone out to "see
about that racket." Now she comes in.
She tells me they have been trying to break
a horse.</p>


<p class="space-above">The same farm, two miles north of Great
Bend, July 8, 1912.</p>

<p>How many times in the counties further
back I have asked with fear and misgiving
for permission to work in the alfalfa, and
have been repulsed when I confessed to the
lack of experience! And now this morning
I have pitched alfalfa hay with the best of
them. We had to go to work early while
the dew softened the leaves. It is a kind
of clover. Once perfectly dry, the leaves
crumble off when the hay is shaken. Then
we must quit. The leaves are the nourishing
part.</p>

<p>The owner of the place, the citified party
who drove me out here the other day and
who is generally back in town, was on top
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of that stack this morning, his collar off,
his town shirt and pants somewhat the worse
for the exertion. He puffed like a porpoise,
for he was putting in place all the hay we
men handed up to him. We lifted the alfalfa
in a long bundle, using our three forks
at one time. We worked like drilled soldiers,
then went in to early dinner.</p>

<p>This is a short note written while the
binder takes the necessary three turns round
the new wheatfield that the tenant's brother
and I are starting to conquer this afternoon.
Three swaths of four bundles each must be
cut, then I will start on my rounds, piling
them into shocks of twelve bundles each.</p>

<p>I am right by the R. F. D. box that goes
with this farm. I will put up the little tin
flag that signals the postman. One of the
four beasts hitched to the reaper is a broncho
colt who came dancing to the field this afternoon,
refusing to keep his head in line with
the rest of the steeds, and, as a consequence,
pulling the whole reaper. It transpires that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the row in the horselot Sunday was caused
by this colt. He jumped up and left his
hoof-print on the chest of the man now driving
him. So the two men tied him up and
beat him all afternoon with a double-tree,
cursing him between whacks, lashing themselves
with Kansas whisky to keep up steam.
Yet he comes dancing to the field.</p>


<p class="space-above">On the farm two miles north of Great
Bend, Wednesday evening, July 10, 1912.</p>

<p>I must write you a short note to-night
while the rest are getting ready for supper.
I will try to mail it to-morrow morning on
the way to the wheat. Let me assure you
that your letter will be heeded. I know
pretty well, by this time, what I can stand,
but if I feel the least bit unfit I will not go
into the sun. That is my understanding
with the tenant who runs the farm. I can
eat and sweat like a Mennonite. I sleep like
a top and wake up fresh as a little daisy.
So far I have gone dancing to the field as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the broncho did. But the broncho is a poor
illustration. He is dead.</p>

<p>The broncho was the property of a little
boy, the son of the man who owns the farm.
The little boy had started with a lamb and
raised it, then sold it for chickens, increasing
his capital by trading and feeding till
it was all concentrated to buy this colt. Then
he and his people moved to town and left
the colt, just at the breaking age, to be
trained for a boy's pet by these men. Since
he became obstreperous, they thought hitching
him to the reaper would cure him, leaving
a draught-horse in the barn to make
place for the unruly one.</p>

<p>The tenant's brother, who drove the reaper,
sent word to the little boy he had not the
least idea what ailed Dick. He hinted to
me later that whatever killed him must have
come from some disease in his head.</p>

<p>Yes, it came from his head. That double-tree
and that pitchfork handle probably
missed his ribs once or twice and hit him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
somewhere around his eyes, in the course of
the Sabbath afternoon services. Two whisky-lashed
colt-breakers can do wonders without
trying. I have been assured that this is
the only way to subdue the beasts, that law
and order must assert themselves or the
whole barnyard will lead an industrial rebellion.
It is past supper now. I have been
writing till the lamp is dim. I must go to
my quilts in the hay.</p>

<p>To-day was the only time the reaper did
not break down every half hour for repairs.
So it was one continuous dance for me and
my friend the broncho till about three o'clock
in the afternoon, when the sun really did its
best. Then the broncho went crazy. He
shoved his head over the backs of two mules
twice his size, and almost pushed them into
the teeth of the sickle.</p>

<p>He was bleeding at the mouth and his
eyes almost popped out of his head. He had
hardly an inch of hide that was whole, and
his raw places were completely covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Kansas flies. And the hot winds have made
the flies so ravenous they draw blood from
the back of the harvester's hand the moment
they alight.</p>

<p>The broncho began to kick in all four
directions at once. He did one good thing.
He pulled the callouses off the hands of the
tenant's brother, the driver, who still gripped
the lines but surrendered his pride and
yelled for me to help. I am as afraid of
bronchos and mules as I am of buzz saws.
Yet we separated the beasts somehow, the
mules safely hitched to the fence, the broncho
between us, held by two halter-ropes.</p>

<p>There was no reasoning with Dick. He
was dying, and dying game. One of the
small boys appeared just then and carried
the alarm. Soon a more savage and indomitable
man with a more eloquent tongue,
the tenant himself, had my end of the rope.
But not the most formidable cursing could
stop Dick from bleeding at the mouth.
Later the draught horse whose place he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
taken was brought over from his pleasant
rest in the barn and the two were tied head
to head. The lordly tenant started to lead
them toward home. But Dick fell down
and died as soon as he reached a patch of
unploughed prairie grass, which, I think,
was the proper end for him. The peaceful
draught horse was put in his place.</p>

<p>The reaper went back to work. The
reaper cut splendidly the rest of this afternoon.
As for me I never shocked wheat with
such machine-like precision. I went at a dog-trot
part of the time, and almost caught
up with the machine.</p>

<p>The broncho should not have been called
Dick. He should have been called Daniel
Boone, or Davy Crockett or Custer or Richard,
yes, Richard the Lion-Hearted. He
came dancing to the field this morning, between
the enormous overshadowing mules,
and dancing feebly this noon. He pulled
the whole reaper till three o'clock. I remember
I asked the driver at noon what made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the broncho dance. He answered: "The
flies on his ribs, I suppose."</p>

<p>I fancy Dick danced because he was made
to die dancing, just as the Spartans rejoiced
and combed their long hair preparing to
face certain death at Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>I think I want on my coat of arms a
broncho, rampant.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Thursday, July 11, 1912.</span> Great Bend,
Kansas.</p>

<p>Yesterday I could lift three moderate-sized
sheaves on the run. This morning I
could hardly lift one, walking. This noon
the foreman of the ranch, the man who, with
his brother, disciplined the broncho, was furiously
angry with me, because, as I plainly
explained, I was getting too much sun and
wanted a bit of a rest. He inquired, "Why
didn't you tell me two days ago you were
going to be overcome by the heat, so I could
have had a man ready to take your place?"
Also, "It's no wonder dirty homeless men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
are walking around the country looking for
jobs." Also, a little later: "I have my opinion
of any man on earth who is a quitter."</p>

<p>But I kept my serenity and told him that
under certain circumstances I was apt to be
a quitter, though, of course, I did not like
to overdo the quitting business. I remained
unruffled, as I say, and handed him and his
brother copies of <i>The Gospel of Beauty</i>
and <i>Rhymes to Be Traded for Bread</i> and
bade them good-bye. Then I went to town
and told the local editor on them for their
horse-killing, which, I suppose, was two-faced
of me.</p>

<p>The tenant's attitude was perfectly absurd.
Hands are terribly scarce. A half
day's delay in shocking that wheat would not
have hurt it, or stopped the reaper, or altered
any of the rest of the farm routine.
He fired me without real hope of a substitute.
I was working for rock-bottom wages
and willing to have them docked all he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
pleased if he would only give me six hours
to catch up in my tiredness.</p>

<p>Anyway, here I am in the Saddlerock
Hotel, to which I have paid in advance a bit
of my wages, in exchange for one night's
rest. I enclose the rest to you. I will start
out on the road to-morrow, bathed, clean,
dead broke and fancy free. I have made
an effort to graduate from beggary into the
respectable laboring class, which you have
so often exhorted me to do.</p>

<p>I shall try for employment again, as soon
as I rest up a bit. I enjoyed the wheat and
the second-hand reaper, and the quaintness
of my employers and all till the death of
Richard the Lion-Hearted.</p>

<p>I am wondering whether I ought to be
as bitter as I am against the horse-killers.
We cannot have green fields just for bronchos
to gambol in, or roads where they can
trot unharnessed and nibble by the way. We
must have Law and Order and Discipline.</p>

<p>But, thanks to the Good St. Francis who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
marks out my path for me, I start to-morrow
morning to trot unharnessed once again.</p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Sunday, July 14, 1912.</span> In front of the
general store at Wright, Kansas, which
same is as small as a town can get.</p>

<p>I have been wondering why Destiny sent
me to that farm where the horse-killers flourished.
I suppose it was that Dick might
have at least one mourner. All the world's
heroes are heroes because they had the qualities
of constancy and dancing gameness that
brought him to his death.</p>

<p>Some day I shall hunt up the right kind
of a Hindu and pay him filthy gold and
have him send the ghost of Dick to those
wretched men. They will be unable to move,
lying with eyes a-staring all night long.
Dreadful things will happen in that room,
dreadful things the Hindu shall devise after
I have told him what the broncho endured.
They shall wake in the morning, thinking it
all a dream till they behold the horse-shoe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
prints all over the counterpane. Then they
will try to sit up and find that their ribs are
broken&mdash;well, I will leave it to the Hindu.</p>

<p>I have been waiting many hours at this
town of Wright. To-day and yesterday I
made seventy-six miles. Thirty-five of these
miles I made yesterday in the automobile of
the genial and scholarly Father A. P. Heimann
of Kinsley, who took me as far as
that point. I have been loafing here at
Wright since about four in the afternoon.
It is nearly dark now. Dozens of harvesters,
already engaged for the week, have been
hanging about and the two stores have kept
open to accommodate them. There is a man
to meet me here at eight o'clock. I may
harvest for him four days. I told him I
would not promise for longer. He has
taken the train to a station further east to
try to get some men for all week. If he
does not return with a full quota he will
take me on. While I am perfectly willing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to work for two dollars and a half, many
hold out for three.</p>

<p>The man I am waiting for overtook me
two miles east of this place. He was hurrying
to catch his train. He took me into his
rig and made the bargain. He turned his
horse over to me and raced for the last car
as we neared the station. So here I am a
few yards from the depot, in front of the
general store, watching the horse of an utter
stranger. Of course the horse isn't worth
stealing, and his harness is half twine and
wire. But the whole episode is so careless
and free and Kansas-like.</p>

<p>Most of the crowd have gone, and I am
awfully hungry. I might steal off the harness
in the dark, and eat it. Somehow I
have not quite the nerve to beg where I expect
to harvest. I am afraid to try again
in this fight with the sun, yet when a man
overtakes me in the road and trusts me with
his best steed and urges me to work for him,
I hardly know how to refuse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>


<p class="space-above"><span class="smcap">Sunday Afternoon, July 21, 1912.</span>
Loafing and dozing on my bed in the granary
on the farm near Wright, Kansas, where
I have been harvesting a full week.</p>

<p>The man I waited for last Sunday afternoon
returned with his full quota of hands
on the "Plug" train about nine o'clock.
Where was I to sleep? I began to think
about a lumber pile I had seen, when I discovered
that five other farmers had climbed
off that train. They were poking around in
all the dark corners for men just like me.
I engaged with a German named Louis Lix
for the whole week, all the time shaking with
misgivings from the memory of my last
break-down. Here it is, Sunday, before I
know it. Lix wants me back again next
year, and is sorry I will not work longer.
I have totalled about sixteen days of harvesting
in Kansas, and though I sagged in the
middle I think I have ended in fair style.
Enclosed find all my wages except enough
for one day's stay at Dodge City and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
real hotel meals there&mdash;sherbet and cheese
and crackers, and finger bowls at the end,
and all such folly. Harvest eating is grand
in its way but somehow lacks frills. Ah,
if eating were as much in my letters as in
my thoughts, this would be nothing but a
series of menus!</p>

<p>I have helped Lix harvest barley, oats and
wheat, mainly wheat. This is the world of
wheat. In this genial region one can stand
on a soap-box and see nothing else to the
horizon. Walking the Santa Fé Trail beside
the railroad means walking till the
enormous wheat-elevator behind one disappears
because of the curvature of the earth,
like the ships in the geography picture, and
walking on and on till finally in the west the
top of another elevator appears, being gradually
revealed because this earth is not flat
like a table, but, as the geography says,
curved like an apple or an orange.</p>

<p>In these fields, instead of working a
reaper with a sickle eight feet long, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
work a header with a twelve-foot sickle. Instead
of four horses to this machine, there
are six. Instead of one man or two following
behind to the left of the driver to pile
sheaves into shocks, a barge, a most copious
slatted receptacle, drives right beside the
header, catching the unbound wheat which
is thrown up loosely by the machine. One
pitchfork man in the barge spreads this cataract
of headed wheat so a full load can be
taken in. His partner guides the team,
keeping precisely with the header.</p>

<p>But these two bargemen do not complete
the outfit. Two others with their barge or
"header-box" come up behind as soon as the
first box starts over to the stack to be unloaded.
Here the sixth man, the stacker,
receives it, and piles it into a small mountain
nicely calculated to resist cyclones. The
green men are broken in as bargemen. The
stacker is generally an old hand.</p>

<p>Unloading the wheat is the hardest part
of the bargeman's work. His fork must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
be full and he must be fast. Otherwise his
partner, who takes turns driving and filling,
and who helps to pitch the wheat out,
will have more than half the pitching to do.
And all the time will be used up. Neither
man will have a rest-period while waiting
for the other barge to come up. This rest-period
is the thing toward which we all
wrestle. If we save it out we drink from
the water-jugs in the corner of the wagon.
We examine where the grasshoppers have
actually bitten little nicks out of our pitchfork
handles, nicks that are apt to make
blisters. We tell our adventures and, when
the header breaks down, and must be
tinkered endlessly, and we have a grand
rest, the stacker sings a list of the most
amazing cowboy songs. He is a young man,
yet rode the range here for seven years before
it became wheat-country. One day
when the songs had become hopelessly,
prosaically pornographic I yearned for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
change. I quoted the first stanza of Atalanta's
chorus:</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When the hounds of Spring are on Winter's traces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother of months, in meadow or plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills the shadows and windy places<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The stacker asked for more. I finished
the chorus. Then I repeated it several times,
while the header was being mended. We
had to get to work. The next morning when
my friend climbed into our barge to ride
to the field he began:</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'When the hounds of Spring are on Winter's traces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother of months, in meadow or plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills the shadows&mdash;&mdash;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Dammit, what's the rest of it? I've been
trying to recite that piece all night."</p>

<p>Now he has the first four stanzas. And
last evening he left for Dodge City to stay
overnight and Sunday. He was resolved to
purchase <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i> and find in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the Public Library <i>The Lady of Shallot</i> and
<i>The Blessed Damozel</i>, besides paying the
usual visit to his wife and children.</p>

<p>Working in a header-barge is fun, more
fun than shocking wheat, even when one is
working for a Mennonite boss. The crew
is larger. There is occasional leisure to be
social. There is more cool wind, for one
is higher in the air. There is variety in the
work. One drives about a third of the time,
guides the wheat into the header a third of
the time and empties the barge a third of
the time. The emptying was the back-breaking
work.</p>

<p>And I was all the while fearful, lest, from
plain awkwardness, or shaking from weariness,
I should stick some man in the eye with
my pitchfork. But I did not. I came
nearer to being a real harvester every day.
The last two days my hands were so hard
I could work without gloves, this despite the
way the grasshoppers had chewed the fork-handle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Believe everything you have ever heard of
the Kansas grasshoppers.</p>

<p>The heights of the header-barge are
dramatically commanding. Kansas appears
much larger than when we are merely standing
in the field. We are just as high as
upon a mountain-peak, for here, as there,
we can see to the very edges of the eternities.</p>

<p>Now let me tell you of a new kind of
weather.</p>

<p>Clouds thicken overhead. The wind turns
suddenly cold. We shiver while we work.
We are liable in five minutes to a hailstorm,
a terrific cloudburst or a cyclone. The
horses are unhitched. The barges are tied
end to end. And <i>still</i> the barges may be
blown away. They must be anchored even
more safely. The long poles to lock the
wheels are thrust under the bed through the
spokes. It has actually been my duty to put
this pole in the wheels every evening to keep
the barges from being blown out of the
barn-lot at night. Such is the accustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
weather excitement in Kansas. Just now
we have excitement that is unusual. But
as the storm is upon us it splits and passes
to the north and south. There is not a drop
of rain.</p>

<p>We are at work again in ten minutes. In
two hours the sky is clear and the air is hot
and alkaline. And ten thousand grasshoppers
are glad to see that good old hot wind
again, you may believe. They are preening
themselves, each man in his place on the slats
of the barge. They are enjoying their chewing
tobacco the same as ever.</p>

<p>Wheat, wheat, wheat, wheat! States and
continents and oceans and solar-systems of
wheat! We poor ne'er-do-weels take our
little part up there in the header half way
between the sky and the earth, and in
the evening going home, carrying Mister
Stacker-Man in our barge, we sing <i>Sweet
Rosy O'Grady</i> and the <i>Battle Hymn of the
Republic</i>. And the most emphatic and unadulterated
tramp among us harvesters, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
giant Swiss fifty years old, gives the yodel
he learned when a boy.</p>

<p>This is a German Catholic family for
which I have been working. We have had
grace before and after every meal, and we
crossed ourselves before and after every
meal, except the Swiss, who left the table
early to escape being blest too much.</p>

<p>My employers are good folk, good as the
Mennonites. My boss was absolutely on the
square all the week, as kind as a hard-working
man has time to be. It gave me great
satisfaction to go to Mass with him this
morning. Though some folks talk against
religion, though it sometimes appears to be
a nuisance, after weighing all the evidence
of late presented, I prefer a religious
farmer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br />

<small><i>The End of the Road; Moonshine; and
Some Proclamations</i></small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">August 1, 1912.</span> Standing up at the
Postoffice desk, Pueblo, Colorado.</p>

<p>Several times since going over the Colorado
border I have had such a cordial reception
for the Gospel of Beauty that my faith
in this method of propaganda is reawakened.
I confess to feeling a new zeal. But
there are other things I want to tell in this
letter.</p>

<p>I have begged my way from Dodge City
on, dead broke, and keeping all the rules
of the road. I have been asked dozens of
times by frantic farmers to help them at
various tasks in western Kansas and eastern
Colorado. I have regretfully refused all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
but half-day jobs, having firmly resolved
not to harvest again till I have well started
upon a certain spiritual enterprise, namely,
the writing of certain new poems that have
taken possession of me in this high altitude,
despite the physical stupidity that comes
with strenuous walking. Thereby hangs a
tale that I have not room for here.</p>

<p>Resolutely setting aside all recent wonders,
I have still a few impressions of the
wheatfield to record. Harvesting time in
Kansas is such a distinctive institution!
Whole villages that are dead any other season
blossom with new rooming signs, fifty
cents a room, or when two beds are in a
room, twenty-five cents a bed. The eating
counters are generally separate from these.
The meals are almost uniformly twenty-five
cents each. The fact that Kansas has no
bar-rooms makes these shabby food-sodden
places into near-taverns, the main assembly
halls for men wanting to be hired, or those
spending their coin. Famous villages where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
an enormous amount of money changes
hands in wages and the sale of wheat-crops
are thus nothing but marvellous lines of
dirty restaurants. In front of the dingy
hotels are endless ancient chairs. Summer
after summer fidgety, sun-fevered, sticky
harvesters have gossiped from chair to chair
or walked toward the dirty band-stand in
the public square, sure, as of old, to be encountered
by the anxious farmer, making
up his crew.</p>

<p>A few harvesters are seen, carrying their
own bedding; grasshopper bitten quilts with
all their colors flaunting and their cotton
gushing out, held together by a shawl-strap
or a rope. Almost every harvester has a
shabby suit-case of the paste-board variety
banging round his ankles. When wages are
rising the harvester, as I have said before,
holds out for the top price. The poor farmer
walks round and round the village half a
day before he consents to the three dollars.
Stacker's wages may be three to five simoleons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and the obdurate farmer may have
to consent to the five lest his wheat go to
seed on the ground. It is a hard situation
for a class that is constitutionally tightwad,
often wisely so.</p>

<p>The roundhouses, water tanks, and all
other places where men stealing freight rides
are apt to pass, have enticing cards tacked
on or near them by the agents of the mayors
of the various towns, giving average wages,
number of men wanted, and urging all harvesters
good and true to come to some particular
town between certain dates. The
multitude of these little cards keeps the harvester
on the alert, and, as the saying is:
"Independent as a hog on ice."</p>

<p>To add to the farmer's distractions, still
fresher news comes by word of mouth that
three hundred men are wanted in a region
two counties to the west, at fifty cents more
a day. It sweeps through the harvesters'
hotels, and there is a great banging of suit-cases,
and the whole town is rushing for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
train. Then there is indeed a nabbing of
men at the station, and sudden surrender on
the part of the farmers, before it is too late.</p>

<p>Harvesting season is inevitably placarded
and dated too soon in one part of the State,
and not soon enough in another. Kansas
weather does not produce its results on
schedule. This makes not one, but many
hurry-calls. It makes the real epic of the
muscle-market.</p>

<p>Stand with me at the station. Behold
the trains rushing by, hour after hour,
freight-cars and palace cars of dishevelled
men! The more elegant the equipage the
more do they put their feet on the seats.
Behold a saturnalia of chewing tobacco and
sunburn and hairy chests, disturbing the
primness and crispness of the Santa Fé,
jostling the tourist and his lovely daughter.</p>

<p>They are a happy-go-lucky set. They
have the reverse of the tightwad's vices. The
harvester, alas, is harvested. Gamblers lie
in wait for him. The scarlet woman has her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
pit digged and ready. It is fun for the
police to lock him up and fine him. No
doubt he often deserves it. I sat half an
afternoon in one of these towns and heard
the local undertaker tell horrible stories of
friendless field hands with no kinsfolk anywhere
discoverable, sunstruck and buried in
a day or so by the county. One man's story
he told in great detail. The fellow had complained
of a headache, and left the field. He
fell dead by the roadside on the way to the
house. He was face downward in an ant
hill. He was eaten into an unrecognizable
mass before they found him at sunset. The
undertaker expatiated on how hard it was
to embalm such folks. It was a discourse
marshalled with all the wealth of detail one
reads in <i>The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar</i>.</p>

<p>The harvester is indeed harvested. He
gambles with sunstroke, disease and damnation.
In one way or another the money
trickles from his loose fingers, and he drifts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
from the wheat in Oklahoma north to the
wheat in Nebraska. He goes to Canada to
shock wheat there as the season recedes, and
then, perhaps, turns on his tracks and makes
for Duluth, Minnesota, we will say. He
takes up lumbering. Or he may make a
circuit of the late fruit crops of Colorado
and California. He is, pretty largely, so
much crude, loose, ungoverned human
strength, more useful than wise. Looked
at closely, he may be the boy from the
machine-shop, impatient for ready money,
the farmer failure turned farm-hand, the
bank-clerk or machine-shop mechanic tired
of slow pay, or the college student on a
lark, in more or less incognito. He may
be the intermittent criminal, the gay-cat or
the travelling religious crank, or the futile
tract-distributer.</p>

<p>And I was three times fraternally accosted
by harvesters who thought my oil-cloth
package of poems was a kit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
burglar's tools. It <i>is</i> a system of breaking
in, I will admit.</p>


<p class="center space-above">A STORY LEFT OUT OF THE
LETTERS</p>

<p>This ends the section of my letters home
that in themselves make a consecutive story.
But to finish with a bit of a nosegay, and
show one of the unexpected rewards of
troubadouring, let me tell the tale of the
Five Little Children Eating Mush.</p>

<p>One should not be so vain as to recount a
personal triumph. Still this is a personal
triumph. And I shall tell it with all pride
and vanity. Let those who dislike a conceited
man drop the book right here.</p>

<p>I had walked all day straight west from
Rocky Ford. It was pitch dark, threatening
rain&mdash;the rain that never comes. It was
nearly ten o'clock. At six I had entered a
village, but had later resolved to press on to
visit a man to whom I had a letter of introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
from my loyal friend Dr. Barbour
of Rocky Ford.</p>

<p>There had been a wash-out. I had to walk
around it, and was misdirected by the good
villagers and was walking merrily on toward
nowhere. Around nine o'clock I had been
refused lodging at three different shanties.
But from long experience I knew that something
would turn up in a minute. And
it did.</p>

<p>I walked right into the fat sides of a big
country hotel on that interminable plain. It
was not surrounded by a village. It was
simply a clean hostelrie for the transient
hands who worked at irrigating in that region.</p>

<p>I asked the looming figure I met in the
dark: "Where is the boss of this place?"</p>

<p>"I am the boss." He had a Scandinavian
twist to his tongue.</p>

<p>"I want a night's lodging. I will give in
exchange an entertainment this evening, or
half a day's work to-morrow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>I followed him up the outside stairway to
the dining-room in the second story. There
was his wife, a woman who greeted me
cheerfully in the Scandinavian accent. She
was laughing at her five little children who
were laughing at her and eating their mush
and milk.</p>

<p>Presumably the boarders had been delayed
by their work, and had dined late.
The children were at it still later.</p>

<p>They were real Americans, those little
birds. And they had memories like parrots,
as will appear.</p>

<p>"Wife," said the landlord, "here is a man
that will entertain us to-night for his keep,
or work for us to-morrow. I think we will
take the entertainment to-night. Go ahead,
mister. Here are the kids. Now listen,
kids."</p>

<p>To come out of the fathomless, friendless
dark and, almost in an instant, to look into
such expectant fairy faces! They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
laughing, laughing, laughing, not in mockery,
but companionship. I recited every
child-piece I had ever written&mdash;(not many).</p>

<p>They kept quite still till the end of each
one. Then they pounded the table for more,
with their tin spoons and their little red
fists.</p>

<p>So, with misgivings, I began to recite
some of my fairy-tales for grown-ups. I
spoke slowly, to make the externals of each
story plain. The audience squealed for
more.... I decided to recite six jingles
about the moon, that I had written long ago:
How the Hyæna said the Moon was a
Golden Skull, and how the Shepherd Dog
contradicted him and said it was a Candle
in the Sky&mdash;and all that and all that.</p>

<p>The success of the move was remarkable
because I had never pleased either grown
folks or children to any extent with those
verses. But these children, through the accumulated
excitements of a day that I knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
nothing about, were in an ecstatic imaginative
condition of soul that transmuted everything.</p>

<p>The last of the series recounted what
Grandpa Mouse said to the Little Mice on
the Moon question. I arranged the ketchup
bottle on the edge of the table for Grandpa
Mouse. I used the salts and peppers for the
little mice in circle round. I used a black
hat or so for the swooping, mouse-eating
owls that came down from the moon. Having
acted out the story first, I recited it,
slowly, mind you. Here it is:</p>


<p class="center">WHAT GRANDPA MOUSE SAID</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The moon's a holy owl-queen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She keeps them in a jar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under her arm till evening,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sallies forth to war.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She pours the owls upon us:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hoot with horrid noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eat the naughty mousie-girls<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And wicked mousie-boys.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So climb the moon-vine every night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the owl-queen pray:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave good green cheese by moonlit trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her to take away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And never squeak, my children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor gnaw the smoke-house door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The owl-queen then will then love us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And send her birds no more."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the end I asked for my room and retired.
I slept maybe an hour. I was awakened
by those tireless little rascals racing
along the dark hall and saying in horrible
solemn tones, pretending to scare one another:</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The moon's a holy owl-queen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She keeps them in a jar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under her arm till night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then 'allies out to war!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sicks the owls upon us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They 'OOT with 'orrid noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eat ... the naughty boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the <span class="smcap">moon's a holy owl-queen!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">She keeps them in a JAR!</span>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And so it went on, over and over.</p>

<p>Thereupon I made a mighty and a rash
resolve. I renewed that same resolve in the
morning when I woke. I said within myself
"<i>I shall write one hundred Poems on the
Moon!</i>"</p>

<p>Of course I did not keep my resolve to
write one hundred pieces about the moon.
But here are a few of those I did write immediately
after:</p>

<p class="center space-above"><big>PROCLAMATIONS</big></p>

<p><i>Immediately upon my return from my
journey the following Proclamations were
printed in Farm and Fireside, through the
great kindness of the editors, as another
phase of the same crusade.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">A PROCLAMATION OF BALM IN GILEAD</p>

<p>Go to the fields, O city laborers, till your
wounds are healed. Forget the street-cars,
the skyscrapers, the slums, the Marseillaise
song.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>We proclaim to the broken-hearted, still
able to labor, the glories of the ploughed
land. The harvests are wonderful. And
there is a spiritual harvest appearing. A
great agricultural flowering of art and song
is destined soon to appear. Where corn and
wheat are growing, men are singing the
psalms of David, not the Marseillaise.</p>

<p>You to whom the universe has become a
blast-furnace, a coke-oven, a cinder-strewn
freight-yard, to whom the history of all ages
is a tragedy with the climax now, to whom
our democracy and our flag are but playthings
of the hypocrite,&mdash;turn to the soil,
turn to the earth, your mother, and she will
comfort you. Rest, be it ever so little, from
your black broodings. Think with the
farmer once more, as your fathers did.
Revere with the farmer our centuries-old
civilization, however little it meets the city's
trouble. Revere the rural customs that have
their roots in the immemorial benefits of
nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>With the farmer look again upon the
Constitution as something brought by
Providence, prepared for by the ages. Go
to church, the cross-roads church, and say
the Lord's Prayer again. Help them with
their temperance crusade. It is a deeper
matter than you think. Listen to the laughter
of the farmer's children. Know that
not all the earth is a-weeping. Know that so
long as there is black soil deep on the prairie,
so long as grass will grow on it, we have a
vast green haven.</p>

<p>The roots of some of our trees are still in
the earth. Our mountains need not to be
moved from their places. Wherever there is
tillable land, there is a budding and blooming
of old-fashioned Americanism, which the
farmer is making splendid for us against
the better day.</p>

<p>There is perpetual balm in Gilead, and
many city workmen shall turn to it and be
healed. This by faith, and a study of the
signs, we proclaim!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">PROCLAMATION</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of the New Time for Farmers and the New
New England</i></p>

<p>Let it be proclaimed and shouted over all
the ploughlands of the United States
that the same ripening that brought our first
culture in New England one hundred years
ago is taking place in America to-day.
Every State is to have its Emerson, its
Whittier, its Longfellow, its Hawthorne
and the rest.</p>

<p>Our Puritan farmer fathers in our
worthiest handful of States waited long for
their first group of burnished, burning
lamps. From the landing of the Pilgrims
in 1620 to the delivery of Emerson's address
on the American Scholar was a weary
period of gestation well rewarded.</p>

<p>Therefore, let us be thankful that we have
come so soon to the edge of this occasion,
that the western farms, though scarcely settled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
have the Chautauqua, which is New
England's old rural lecture course; the temperance
crusade, which is New England's
abolitionism come again; the magazine militant,
which is the old Atlantic Monthly combined
with the Free-Soil Newspaper under
a new dress; and educational reform, which
is the Yankee school-house made glorious.</p>

<p>All these, and more, electrify the farm-lands.
Things are in that ferment where
many-sided Life and Thought are born.</p>

<p>Because our West and South are richer
and broader and deeper than New England,
so much more worth while will our work be.
We will come nearer to repeating the spirit
of the best splendors of the old Italian villages
than to multiplying the prunes and
prisms of Boston.</p>

<p>The mystery-seeking, beauty-serving followers
of Poe in their very revolt from
democracy will serve it well. The Pan-worshipping
disciples of Whitman will in the
end be, perhaps, more useful brothers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
White Christ than all our coming saints.
And men will not be infatuated by the written
and spoken word only, as in New England.
Every art shall have the finest devotion.</p>

<p>Already in this more tropical California,
this airier Colorado, this black-soiled Illinois,
in Georgia, with her fire-hearted tradition
of chivalry and her new and most romantic
prosperity, men have learned to pray to the
God of the blossoming world, men have
learned to pray to the God of Beauty. They
meditate upon His ways. They have begun
to sing.</p>

<p>As of old, their thoughts and songs begin
with the land, and go directly back to the
land. Their tap-roots are deep as those
of the alfalfa. A new New England is
coming, a New England of ninety million
souls! An artistic Renaissance is coming.
An America is coming such as was long ago
prophesied in Emerson's address on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
American Scholar. This by faith, and a
study of the signs, we proclaim!</p>


<p class="center">PROCLAMATION</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of the New Village, and the New Country
Community, as Distinct from the Village</i></p>

<p>This is a year of bumper crops, of harvesting
festivals. Through the mists
of the happy waning year, a new village
rises, and the new country community, in
visions revealed to the rejoicing heart of
faith.</p>

<p>And yet it needs no vision to see them.
Walking across this land I have found
them, little ganglions of life, promise of
thousands more. The next generation will
be that of the eminent village. The son of
the farmer will be no longer dazzled and destroyed
by the fires of the metropolis. He
will travel, but only for what he can bring
back. Just as his father sends half-way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
across the continent for good corn, or melon-seed,
so he will make his village famous by
transplanting and growing this idea or that.
He will make it known for its pottery or
its processions, its philosophy or its peacocks,
its music or its swans, its golden roofs
or its great union cathedral of all faiths.
There are a thousand miscellaneous achievements
within the scope of the great-hearted
village. Our agricultural land to-day holds
the ploughboys who will bring these benefits.
I have talked to these boys. I know them.
I have seen their gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>And the lonely country neighborhood, as
distinct from the village, shall make itself
famous. There are river valleys that will
be known all over the land for their tall men
and their milk-white maidens, as now for
their well-bred horses. There are mountain
lands that shall cultivate the tree of knowledge,
as well as the apple-tree. There are
sandy tracts that shall constantly ripen red
and golden citrus fruit, but as well, philosophers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
comforting as the moon, and strength-giving
as the sun.</p>

<p>These communities shall have their proud
circles. They shall have families joined
hand in hand, to the end that new blood and
new thoughts be constantly brought in, and
no good force or leaven be lost. The country
community shall awaken illustrious.
This by faith, and a study of the signs, we
proclaim!</p>


<p class="center">PROCLAMATION</p>

<p class="center"><i>Welcoming the Talented Children of the
Soil</i></p>

<p>Because of their closeness to the
earth, the men on the farms increase
in stature and strength.</p>

<p>And for this very reason a certain proportion
of their children are being born with
a finer strength. They are being born with
all this power concentrated in their nerves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
They have the magnificent thoughts that
might stir the stars in their courses, were
they given voice.</p>

<p>Yea, in almost every ranch-house is born
one flower-like girl or boy, a stranger among
the brothers and sisters. Welcome, and a
thousand welcomes, to these fairy changelings!
They will make our land lovely. Let
all of us who love God give our hearts to
these His servants. They are born with eyes
that weep themselves blind, unless there is
beauty to look upon. They are endowed
with souls that are self-devouring, unless
they be permitted to make rare music; with
a desire for truth that will make them mad
as the old prophets, unless they be permitted
to preach and pray and praise God in their
own fashion, each establishing his own dream
visibly in the world.</p>

<p>The land is being jewelled with talented
children, from Maine to California: souls
dewy as the grass, eyes wondering and passionate,
lips that tremble. Though they be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
born in hovels, they have slender hands,
seemingly lost amid the heavy hands. They
have hands that give way too soon amid the
bitter days of labor, but are everlastingly
patient with the violin, or chisel, or brush,
or pen.</p>

<p>All these children as a sacred charge are
appearing, coming down upon the earth like
manna. Yet many will be neglected as the
too-abundant mulberry, that is left upon the
trees. Many will perish like the wild strawberries
of Kansas, cut down by the roadside
with the weeds. Many will be looked upon
like an over-abundant crop of apples, too
cheap to be hauled to market, often used as
food for the beasts. There will be a great
slaughter of the innocents, more bloody than
that of Herod of old. But there will be a
desperate hardy remnant, adepts in all the
conquering necromancy of agricultural
Song and democratic Craftsmanship. They
will bring us our new time in its completeness.

<p class="center">PROCLAMATION</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Coming of Religion, Equality and
Beauty</i></p>

<p>In our new day, so soon upon us, for the
first time in the history of Democracy,
art and the church shall be hand in hand and
equally at our service. Neither craftsmanship
nor prayer shall be purely aristocratic
any more, nor at war with each other, nor
at war with the State. The priest, the statesman
and the singer shall discern one
another's work more perfectly and give
thanks to God.</p>

<p>Even now our best churches are blossoming
in beauty. Our best political life, whatever
the howlers may say, is tending toward
equality, beauty and holiness.</p>

<p>Political speech will cease to turn only
upon the price of grain, but begin considering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the price of cross-roads fountains and
people's palaces. Our religious life will no
longer trouble itself with the squabbles of
orthodoxy. It will give us the outdoor choral
procession, the ceremony of dedicating the
wheat-field or the new-built private house to
God. That politician who would benefit the
people will not consider all the world
wrapped up in the defence or destruction of
a tariff schedule. He will serve the public
as did Pericles, with the world's greatest
dramas. He will rebuild the local Acropolis.
He will make his particular Athens rule by
wisdom and philosophy, not trade alone.
Our crowds shall be audiences, not hurrying
mobs; dancers, not brawlers; observers, not
restless curiosity-seekers. Our mobs shall
becomes assemblies and our assemblies religious;
devout in a subtle sense, equal in privilege
and courtesy, delicate of spirit, a
perfectly rounded democracy.</p>

<p>All this shall come through the services of
three kinds of men in wise coöperation: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
priests, the statesmen and the artists. Our
priests shall be religious men like St. Francis,
or John Wesley, or General Booth, or Cardinal
Newman. They shall be many types,
but supreme of their type.</p>

<p>Our statesmen shall find their exemplars
and their inspiration in Washington, Jefferson
and Lincoln, as all good Americans
devoutly desire.</p>

<p>But even these cannot ripen the land without
the work of men as versatile as William
Morris or Leonardo. Our artists shall fuse
the work of these other workers, and give
expression to the whole cry and the whole
weeping and rejoicing of the land. We
shall have Shelleys with a heart for religion,
Ruskins with a comprehension of equality.</p>

<p><i>Religion</i>, <i>equality</i> and <i>beauty</i>! By these
America shall come into a glory that shall
justify the yearning of the sages for her
perfection, and the prophecies of the poets,
when she was born in the throes of Valley
Forge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p><i>This, by faith, and a study of the signs,
we proclaim!</i></p></blockquote>
